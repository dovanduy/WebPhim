For 2% extra interest,
people are queuing up to deposit money.

10
00:01:45,686 --> 00:01:49,178
Are you here for a coffee?
- No, to invest.

Son will not get even if deposit,
daughter will get even if l don't.

14
00:01:54,861 --> 00:01:56,192
That's why for her marriage.

15
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:03,165
What's the collection?

16
00:02:07,841 --> 00:02:09,172
What's the celebration for?

00:02:09,376 --> 00:02:13,005
With your Rs.5 lakhs,
our deposit has touched Rs.1,500 crores.

18
00:02:13,213 --> 00:02:16,705
Will l get any gift?
- We'll give you a receipt.- Receipt?

19
00:02:19,219 --> 00:02:21,380
Call the chairman.

20
00:02:21,555 --> 00:02:23,716
How many times do l have to tell
l don't get a proper signal here?

21
00:02:25,559 --> 00:02:28,551
Varadarajulu Sir,
l'm Srinivasa Rao here.

22
00:02:28,729 --> 00:02:32,688
From Parvathipuram to Visakhapatnam,
23 branches together in 40 days,

23
00:02:32,866 --> 00:02:34,697
we've collected Rs.1,500 crores.

24
00:02:34,868 --> 00:02:37,200
This is a record Sir.
- Good.

25
00:02:44,911 --> 00:02:49,746
Won't Rs.1,500 crores be of this high?

26
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:54,250
Road curves a little between
Rishikonda to Bhimli,

27
00:02:54,421 --> 00:02:55,752
like a girl's waist,

28
00:02:55,922 --> 00:02:59,585
we've a 10 acre bit of land
exactly there Bittu.

29
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,561
lf we sit there,
entire Vizag will be under our feet.

30
00:03:04,731 --> 00:03:07,222
l used to sit there as a kid.

31
00:03:07,434 --> 00:03:11,598
l've heard there one such bit of
land exactly like that in Hyderabad.

32
00:03:11,738 --> 00:03:14,070
l want to sit there!

33
00:03:14,241 --> 00:03:16,072
To do that we must have power.

34
00:03:18,245 --> 00:03:19,234
True!

35
00:03:19,946 --> 00:03:24,178
To get power we must have at least 1,000!
Get it.

36
00:03:27,454 --> 00:03:30,287
ls 1,000 enough?
We take the risk to steal it.

37
00:03:30,457 --> 00:03:33,449
Should we take 500 after
giving you 1,000?

38
00:03:34,795 --> 00:03:38,094
Your younger brother is
young and energetic.

39
00:03:39,433 --> 00:03:41,765
Your brother would take risk and steal it.

40
00:03:41,935 --> 00:03:43,766
Who would send him to foreign?

41
00:03:46,273 --> 00:03:50,471
Travel Murthy!
No:1 travel agent in lndia.

42
00:03:50,644 --> 00:03:52,976
He'll arrange your visas and passports.

43
00:03:53,113 --> 00:03:55,479
He'll help you get out of lndia
in 24 hours.

44
00:03:55,649 --> 00:04:00,313
He'll deposit Rs.500 crores in
offshore account in 48 hours.

45
00:04:00,487 --> 00:04:01,545
ls it enough?

46
00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:03,888
1,000 is correct, right?

47
00:04:04,491 --> 00:04:10,828
Lala, if you say car people only see
tyres, brakes, sheets, and steering.

48
00:04:10,964 --> 00:04:13,125
The most important thing is petrol.

49
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:16,667
lt is not seen to the eye.
Car won't move without it.

50
00:04:16,803 --> 00:04:18,134
l'm petrol.

51
00:04:21,975 --> 00:04:24,136
Never do for free the job
you know well.

52
00:04:25,011 --> 00:04:27,571
Never try what you don't know.

53
00:04:29,015 --> 00:04:33,247
We're experts in opening lockers.
Let's take money and do it.

54
00:04:35,355 --> 00:04:38,847
His job is to keep us away
from going to jail.

55
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,349
When do you want it?

56
00:04:42,028 --> 00:04:43,689
Today is Friday,

57
00:04:43,997 --> 00:04:47,330
cash will reach Reserve Bank
by Monday morning.

58
00:04:47,534 --> 00:04:49,161
Better to bring it by Sunday night.

59
00:04:49,336 --> 00:04:50,997
ls it a problem if l get it tonight?

60
00:04:51,171 --> 00:04:52,331
ls this time enough for you?

61
00:04:52,539 --> 00:04:55,997
Earning may take time but
stealing won't take much time.

62
00:04:58,044 --> 00:04:58,703
What?

63
00:04:59,713 --> 00:05:01,544
Today is Friday.

64
00:05:01,715 --> 00:05:05,879
Cash will reach Reserve Bank
by Monday morning.

65
00:05:18,365 --> 00:05:22,563
Select 8 people.

66
00:05:22,702 --> 00:05:26,365
They must not know each other.

67
00:05:26,573 --> 00:05:31,567
Nobody must know you're the kingpin.

68
00:05:31,912 --> 00:05:36,576
l want 8 young men,
they mustn't know each other.

69
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:40,083
Nobody must know l'm the kingpin.

70
00:05:40,253 --> 00:05:43,916
Not a note must be in the bank
tomorrow other than change Lala.

71
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:45,921
l think security will be heavy brother.

72
00:05:48,595 --> 00:05:52,395
Someone from up above should
come down to stop us!

73
00:06:16,122 --> 00:06:19,614
A train leaving the platform
at 60 miles per hour,

74
00:06:19,793 --> 00:06:23,957
how fast should a 50 kg man
run to catch it?

75
00:06:24,764 --> 00:06:26,755
Why are you laughing?
- Nothing father.

76
00:06:26,933 --> 00:06:30,096
ls it ajoke?
- The math is wrong.

77
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:34,263
What's that? Wrong?
What is it?

78
00:06:34,441 --> 00:06:37,433
Train will stop in platform
at that speed.

79
00:06:37,644 --> 00:06:41,307
Forget about school children
even Superman can't catch it.

80
00:06:41,481 --> 00:06:42,470
He'll fall down.

81
00:06:42,816 --> 00:06:45,979
Don't tell such wrong examples,
children would die father.

82
00:06:48,321 --> 00:06:50,152
Then, tell me what is
right calculation?

83
00:06:52,325 --> 00:06:58,457
A 50 kg man is waiting in traffic
signal in a crore worth BMW car,

84
00:06:58,632 --> 00:06:59,963
how much time would that train
take to cross the crossing?

85
00:07:01,134 --> 00:07:03,659
Ask them like that, they'll have
some hope of future father.

86
00:07:03,837 --> 00:07:06,829
Train from childhood,
won't you let us get into cars?

87
00:07:06,973 --> 00:07:09,464
Be rich at least in thoughts,
it's free, right father?

88
00:07:10,477 --> 00:07:12,672
Find an answer to the
question by tomorrow.

89
00:07:12,846 --> 00:07:15,007
The question asked by brother?
- No, my question.

90
00:07:15,181 --> 00:07:17,172
lf we run, we may fall under the train.

91
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:19,841
lf you fall die,
but find an answer from your dad.

92
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:22,181
Go home now, move!

93
00:07:22,355 --> 00:07:23,344
You should've seen his face.

94
00:07:23,523 --> 00:07:25,684
Why are you mother and
son laughing so much?

95
00:07:25,859 --> 00:07:27,850
Why did you ask him and got insulted?
Then shouting at us!

96
00:07:28,028 --> 00:07:30,019
Feed him like a bull!

97
00:07:30,196 --> 00:07:31,823
Mother, l want another dosa.
- Okay.

98
00:07:31,998 --> 00:07:34,159
Not just one, eat 10 and
build your body like a wrestler.

99
00:07:34,334 --> 00:07:36,700
Look at his biceps,
looks like a stone crusher.

100
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:40,863
To show that he roams around
in vest to impress my friends.

101
00:07:41,041 --> 00:07:42,702
Great friends!

102
00:07:42,876 --> 00:07:46,334
You wear shirt in home also,
evil eyes!

103
00:07:47,714 --> 00:07:48,874
Not a hope of coming good in life.

104
00:07:49,049 --> 00:07:51,381
Sleeping late night and
waking up at 10 am next morning.

105
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:53,712
He'll come good if he wakes up early.

106
00:07:53,887 --> 00:07:56,219
Hen too wakes up early morning,
what's the use?

107
00:07:56,389 --> 00:07:58,721
People are eating it!
- What's your idea then?

108
00:07:58,892 --> 00:08:01,383
l don't want a middle class
life like yours.

109
00:08:01,561 --> 00:08:04,052
One shot and life must get settled.

110
00:08:04,197 --> 00:08:08,725
l can't rush to bargain sales
in super market and cinema theatres.

111
00:08:08,868 --> 00:08:11,029
lf l go to watch a film,
entire row must be empty.

112
00:08:11,204 --> 00:08:15,732
Then become a goon, not just
a row entire theatre would be empty.

113
00:08:15,909 --> 00:08:17,376
ls it so easy to make money?

114
00:08:17,544 --> 00:08:19,739
lt's not a big deal to make money...

115
00:08:19,913 --> 00:08:23,246
Who is it?
- Chiranjeevi in film 'Challenge' father.

116
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:25,577
Reduce the volume.
- Hit film!

117
00:08:25,752 --> 00:08:28,243
Making money isn't making few bucks,

118
00:08:28,421 --> 00:08:30,412
l'll earn Rs.50 lakhs in 5 years,

119
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:31,921
l don't have that much patience.

120
00:08:32,092 --> 00:08:36,256
Give me Rs.10,000, in two hours
l'll make it Rs.1 lakh.

121
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:40,729
ln two hours?
That's my four months'salary!

122
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:45,234
lt'll take 120 days.
Can you make it 120 minutes?

123
00:08:47,407 --> 00:08:50,274
He'll do it.
- He's too smart!

124
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:51,934
Rs.10,000.

125
00:08:52,112 --> 00:08:53,773
You don't give me Rs.100 too.

126
00:08:53,947 --> 00:08:57,940
You keep quiet.
He's asking to earn

127
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:06,949
Hi aunts! What are you doing in rain?

128
00:09:07,127 --> 00:09:10,460
Nothing, just testing the new
umbrella if it is working or not.

129
00:09:11,765 --> 00:09:13,494
Someone is going to lose Rs.1 lakh!

130
00:09:14,267 --> 00:09:16,258
Hey Suri! Why haven't you yet come?

131
00:09:16,436 --> 00:09:18,427
You go, l'll join you.
- Cut it.

132
00:09:19,973 --> 00:09:23,306
Listen to the second part
of story 'Bhairava Kona'.

133
00:09:23,443 --> 00:09:25,809
Story till now, after fighting father...

134
00:09:25,979 --> 00:09:28,971
l need to go urgently,
can you please give me lift?

135
00:09:29,149 --> 00:09:31,982
...he meets a wizard on the way...

136
00:09:32,152 --> 00:09:36,145
Wizard told him about
the treasure in the pond.

137
00:09:36,322 --> 00:09:42,158
Prince and Wizard together went in
the same direction for the treasure.

138
00:09:42,328 --> 00:09:44,796
Listen now, 'Bhairava Kona'...

139
00:09:44,964 --> 00:09:47,831
Do you also play?
- Where are you going?

140
00:09:47,967 --> 00:09:50,128
Ecstasy pub.
- Party?

141
00:09:50,303 --> 00:09:54,637
No money to party or
status to throw a party Sir.- Then?

142
00:09:55,308 --> 00:09:57,640
lPL season, a little betting.

143
00:10:00,013 --> 00:10:02,004
Are they betting so much in Vizag?

144
00:10:02,182 --> 00:10:03,843
What are you saying Sir?

145
00:10:04,017 --> 00:10:08,852
This one night money at stake in Ecstasy
pub in East Vizag equals state budget.

146
00:10:09,022 --> 00:10:10,182
Don't police know it?

147
00:10:10,356 --> 00:10:13,348
lf they know, they'd be there only,
don't bother even if banks are looted.

148
00:10:17,363 --> 00:10:19,160
Always playing Radio Mirchi!

149
00:10:20,867 --> 00:10:24,234
My wish, l'll listen to that only.
- Stop here please.

150
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,871
Be careful with money,
someone may steal from you.

151
00:10:29,042 --> 00:10:31,203
l'm smart,
nobody can steal it from me.

152
00:10:31,377 --> 00:10:33,208
No smart man would claim it.

153
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:41,218
We must, even cigarette packs
have statutory warning.

154
00:10:41,387 --> 00:10:45,221
Stay away from me, dare touch me,
you'd die, l must announce, right?

155
00:10:53,032 --> 00:10:57,059
To do all the colours,
it'll take minimum a week.

156
00:10:57,203 --> 00:10:58,534
He did in 5 minutes.

157
00:11:07,413 --> 00:11:08,402
Why are you late?

158
00:11:08,581 --> 00:11:11,414
Suri didn't come,
l had to wait for him.

159
00:11:11,584 --> 00:11:12,573
What's the situation?

160
00:11:13,586 --> 00:11:15,747
Oh! How much did Chennai score?

161
00:11:18,758 --> 00:11:20,089
ls Dhoni still playing or out?

162
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,592
He's still there,
45 runs in 20 balls.

163
00:11:22,762 --> 00:11:25,230
What's the betting rate?
- 10:12 going on!

164
00:11:25,398 --> 00:11:29,232
Tell me clearly,
l've challenged my father.

165
00:11:30,403 --> 00:11:34,567
Very simple matter,
if Dhoni hits a six, we'll get a lakh.

166
00:11:34,741 --> 00:11:36,402
lf he misses out, we'll lose Rs.12,000!

167
00:11:36,576 --> 00:11:38,942
l've Rs.10,000.
- l'll adjust Rs.2,000.

168
00:11:39,112 --> 00:11:41,774
Take down Rs.1 lakh betting
at 12 paise on CSK.

169
00:11:44,117 --> 00:11:45,607
Who do you think would win today Sir?

170
00:11:48,121 --> 00:11:49,782
lf everything l wish comes true,

171
00:11:49,956 --> 00:11:54,290
l would wish to beocme the CM,
why would l wish others to win?

172
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,791
Mind your work.

173
00:11:56,129 --> 00:11:56,959
What happened to him?

174
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:59,598
Dhoni hit a four when he was
in that position,

175
00:11:59,766 --> 00:12:01,597
for sentiment we made
him sit like that.

176
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:06,268
Dhoni hit a six!

177
00:12:06,439 --> 00:12:08,669
l've had 12, am l shouting?

178
00:12:15,815 --> 00:12:18,147
Keep ready my one lakh!

179
00:12:18,318 --> 00:12:19,979
Bloody, he won!

180
00:12:33,967 --> 00:12:35,127
How many fingers are these?

181
00:12:35,301 --> 00:12:37,997
Are you so drunk unable to
see your own fingers Sir?

182
00:12:38,471 --> 00:12:41,463
Why are you beating Sir?
l've license to run a bar.

183
00:12:41,641 --> 00:12:44,007
They've money, they're drinking.
What's your problem?

184
00:12:44,177 --> 00:12:49,342
l've information.
They bribed! l got irritated!

185
00:12:53,186 --> 00:12:54,517
Sir, l'm there.

186
00:12:54,687 --> 00:12:57,178
Third building,
second left from main road!

187
00:12:57,357 --> 00:12:59,188
lt's Ecstasy Pub Sir.

188
00:12:59,359 --> 00:13:02,692
Sir, it seems if we raid the place
we'll get money equal to state budget.

189
00:13:02,862 --> 00:13:06,992
Take other staff also,
you've lD Party Madhu,

190
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:08,827
by then tell them to get the address.

191
00:13:10,837 --> 00:13:14,204
Why are you laughing?
What's so funny about it?

192
00:13:18,378 --> 00:13:22,371
l didn't know l speak funny
till you laughed at me.

193
00:13:23,216 --> 00:13:25,047
The address you said just now,

194
00:13:27,887 --> 00:13:30,048
exactly an hour earlier l told a man.

195
00:13:31,224 --> 00:13:37,857
Betting in East Vizag,
money equaling state's budget.

196
00:13:38,031 --> 00:13:39,692
l laughed hearing my own words.

197
00:13:39,866 --> 00:13:43,063
You mean the man who gave us
information is a criminal?- Definitely!

198
00:13:43,202 --> 00:13:45,067
Can't he be a responsible citizen?

199
00:13:45,238 --> 00:13:48,071
Had he been,
he would've told name and number.

200
00:13:51,244 --> 00:13:55,908
Okay agreed he may commit crime,
what could it be?

201
00:13:56,082 --> 00:14:01,577
Good number are here and
half of them are in East Vizag,

202
00:14:03,423 --> 00:14:08,918
what better time one would get to
loot the bank near control room Sir?

203
00:14:12,565 --> 00:14:14,726
How can you be so sure they're robbers?

204
00:14:14,901 --> 00:14:17,392
Where would a group of people
go in such heavy rain?

205
00:14:18,104 --> 00:14:20,902
Marriage? lt's not marriage season.

206
00:14:21,107 --> 00:14:23,439
Going out? No luggage.

207
00:14:23,609 --> 00:14:25,440
Monkey caps to mask faces,

208
00:14:26,612 --> 00:14:29,103
cutters to cut open fencing wires.

209
00:14:30,116 --> 00:14:32,448
tool box to open lockers,

210
00:14:33,286 --> 00:14:37,950
most important factor in all
the people was fear in eyes.

211
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:41,286
Not a man was smiling!

212
00:14:41,627 --> 00:14:46,087
Man is like that only when he's about
to do something good or bad thing.

213
00:14:47,266 --> 00:14:48,756
Why should l trust you?

214
00:14:48,935 --> 00:14:51,301
Not just you, nobody trusts logic.

215
00:14:51,437 --> 00:14:52,768
Everyone want magic!

216
00:14:52,939 --> 00:14:55,931
That's why God men are more famous
here than scientists.

217
00:15:06,319 --> 00:15:10,153
Behind VClB Bank...

218
00:15:23,302 --> 00:15:24,462
Who are you?

219
00:15:24,637 --> 00:15:25,865
Do you've match box?

220
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:47,352
How many in the group?
- About 10!

221
00:15:47,527 --> 00:15:49,688
l think we've many to share.

222
00:15:49,862 --> 00:15:52,660
That's why l was ordered to dump you
after cutting the wire.

223
00:15:53,499 --> 00:15:54,488
Who is there?

224
00:17:18,951 --> 00:17:20,782
We can't open this locker!

225
00:17:22,788 --> 00:17:25,279
We can!
lf we've the keys!

226
00:17:26,792 --> 00:17:29,124
l think staff is still there
inside the strong room.

227
00:17:29,462 --> 00:17:31,089
They may have the keys.

228
00:18:50,176 --> 00:18:51,871
Who killed them? ls it you?

229
00:18:52,011 --> 00:18:54,536
Tell me!
- Don't shout!

230
00:18:55,047 --> 00:18:56,537
They'd get scared!

231
00:19:02,221 --> 00:19:06,385
lf you don't open the door,
my boys would knock the door of your home.

232
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:09,221
Will you open the door or
want your wife to open the door?

233
00:19:18,404 --> 00:19:19,564
Open the locker!

234
00:19:43,596 --> 00:19:46,064
Have you killed them?
ls everyone dead?

235
00:19:46,232 --> 00:19:47,392
Who planned this?

236
00:19:47,566 --> 00:19:50,228
Ten entered the fence
but only two are remaining.

237
00:19:51,237 --> 00:19:54,229
Finally only one would go out.
Will you kill me also?

238
00:19:55,608 --> 00:19:57,235
l'll kill the crane driver.

239
00:20:37,483 --> 00:20:38,313
Stop Sir...no Sir.

240
00:20:39,652 --> 00:20:42,314
We'll not get anything in that car.

241
00:20:44,323 --> 00:20:46,484
They're purposefully using light to go.

242
00:20:47,827 --> 00:20:49,886
Couldn't they escape in darkness?

243
00:20:53,132 --> 00:20:56,795
Crane wires are still moving.
lt had lifted money, right?

244
00:21:02,308 --> 00:21:06,005
Engine is still hot,
it broke open the wall, right?

245
00:21:09,348 --> 00:21:11,179
Heavy laden vehicle went this way.

246
00:21:14,353 --> 00:21:15,513
Heavy cash!

247
00:21:16,856 --> 00:21:17,686
Money...

248
00:21:32,004 --> 00:21:32,698
Brother!

249
00:21:32,838 --> 00:21:34,169
Police are after you.

250
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:39,610
A little further up, there's a
dumping yard, park vehicle there.

251
00:21:43,048 --> 00:21:48,714
Greater Visakha Municipal Corporation
Dumping Yard...Time Midnight...

252
00:21:48,888 --> 00:21:50,219
Nobody would suspect money
will be in trash.

253
00:21:50,389 --> 00:22:00,697
Even if they can't stand the stench.

254
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:28,992
My vehicle is damaged,
come immediately to VClB left.

255
00:22:30,763 --> 00:22:32,060
Brother, police are here.

256
00:22:32,231 --> 00:22:37,225
l'll call Varadarajulu, ensure
nobody sees the money at any cost.

257
00:22:37,403 --> 00:22:39,064
lf necessary, kill them.

258
00:22:39,238 --> 00:22:41,934
You be careful, l'm coming there.

259
00:22:51,283 --> 00:22:52,944
Who are you?

260
00:22:55,955 --> 00:22:58,116
Kill him or else he may kill me!

261
00:23:03,629 --> 00:23:06,655
Try to live for a minute,
l'll kill him in 2 minutes

262
00:23:26,986 --> 00:23:32,652
Archer without thumb and gunman
without pointing finger are useless.

263
00:23:49,842 --> 00:23:52,675
Brother!

264
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:12,657
Shift the body to hospital.

265
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:16,164
Sir, money is somewhere here only.

266
00:24:16,335 --> 00:24:17,700
He'll tell if we thrash him.

267
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:19,167
lt's better to confiscate
the cash now Sir.

268
00:24:19,338 --> 00:24:22,501
Leave the place now Ravi.
You'll get into legal troubles.

269
00:24:22,708 --> 00:24:23,868
Just once...

270
00:24:26,879 --> 00:24:28,540
Have Ravi dropped a home.

271
00:24:48,534 --> 00:24:50,024
Don't know how many murders
he has committed?

272
00:24:50,202 --> 00:24:52,033
They've brought him in fourjeeps.

273
00:24:52,905 --> 00:24:55,738
One getting down from police jeep
isn't a criminal always.

274
00:24:55,908 --> 00:24:57,375
One can be a VlP too!

275
00:24:57,543 --> 00:25:02,071
You're very intelligence,
can't you listen to elders advice?

276
00:25:02,247 --> 00:25:03,407
You'd come good in life.

277
00:25:03,582 --> 00:25:06,244
Why anyone else?
l'll listen to you.

278
00:25:06,418 --> 00:25:08,249
Can you get me the post of
Prime Minister by morning?

279
00:25:09,588 --> 00:25:12,580
He's killing with words,
where was he born?

280
00:25:30,576 --> 00:25:34,103
What bothers you
wherever l may be born bro...

281
00:25:34,279 --> 00:25:37,771
What bothers you
however l may look bro...

282
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:41,442
What bothers you
whatever l may do bro...

283
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:43,451
Don't irritate me bro!

284
00:25:43,622 --> 00:25:46,955
What bothers yo
if l smoke bro...

285
00:25:47,126 --> 00:25:50,618
What bothers you
if l play drums bro...

286
00:25:50,796 --> 00:25:54,254
What bothers you
if l wink at girls bro...

287
00:25:54,433 --> 00:25:56,094
lf l hit your teeth
would spill like beans...

288
00:25:56,268 --> 00:25:58,259
How many buttons does my shirt has...

289
00:25:58,437 --> 00:25:59,802
How many preventive vaccines
have l taken...

290
00:25:59,972 --> 00:26:01,599
How many holes do
my pair ofjeans has...

291
00:26:01,807 --> 00:26:03,434
How many zeroes do
my cell phone number has...

292
00:26:03,609 --> 00:26:05,440
How much loans my dad
owes to other...

293
00:26:05,611 --> 00:26:07,306
How many rakhis does
my sister has...

294
00:26:07,446 --> 00:26:10,973
Stop asking such crazy questions...

295
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:14,984
l'm a purebred loafer
what bothers you bro...

296
00:26:16,155 --> 00:26:18,146
l'm a loafer...

297
00:26:53,692 --> 00:26:56,855
Don't know whose photo is
behind the poster...

298
00:26:57,029 --> 00:27:00,487
Don't know what wound is
behind the plaster...

299
00:27:00,666 --> 00:27:02,327
Don't know which sixer
is behind which ball...

300
00:27:02,501 --> 00:27:04,162
You can see only after it is hit!

301
00:27:04,336 --> 00:27:07,669
Don't know what product
is behind the label...

302
00:27:07,873 --> 00:27:11,206
Don't know which table
has a drawer...

303
00:27:11,376 --> 00:27:14,868
Without touching or laying your
hand, how can you say it...

304
00:27:15,047 --> 00:27:16,708
All that is white isn't biesting milk...

305
00:27:16,882 --> 00:27:18,372
All that is black isn't soil...

306
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:20,211
All that glitters isn't gold...

307
00:27:20,385 --> 00:27:21,875
All that fades isn't old...

308
00:27:22,054 --> 00:27:25,217
Don't judge by appearances,
it's wrong bro...

309
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:29,554
Stop inquiring about me bro...

310
00:27:50,582 --> 00:27:53,745
My name is peppermint...
My body is high voltage current...

311
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:58,253
My shape is trumpet...
My looks are bullets...

312
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:04,423
l'm sweeter than sugar...
Hotter than your liquor...

313
00:28:04,596 --> 00:28:08,726
My face is bed light...
l'll brighten up the night...

314
00:28:11,937 --> 00:28:15,270
The town is in chaos...
Affairs fill the night life...

315
00:28:15,407 --> 00:28:18,740
Jigs of love fill darkness...
That's my highlight...

316
00:28:20,445 --> 00:28:22,606
Come loafer...

317
00:28:23,782 --> 00:28:26,273
l'll show you bliss...

318
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:41,763
According you l'm useless...
According me l belong to A class...

319
00:28:41,967 --> 00:28:45,596
Your worry is yours and my fight is mine...
Why should we clash?

320
00:28:45,771 --> 00:28:52,472
l'm a mad man, what do l know?
lt's just time pass for you...

321
00:28:52,611 --> 00:28:56,138
You can use a lens to see
my seriousness...

322
00:28:56,481 --> 00:28:59,814
Tendulkar failed 10th class,
didn't he become master of cricket?

323
00:28:59,985 --> 00:29:03,477
Paperboy to Presidency,
didn't we the story of Abdul Kalam?

324
00:29:03,655 --> 00:29:06,488
Whose fate takes to where
nobody knows...

325
00:29:06,658 --> 00:29:10,992
You're not competent enough
to decide that bro...

326
00:29:34,186 --> 00:29:36,017
Next day...

327
00:29:42,027 --> 00:29:43,187
This is very hot guru!

328
00:29:43,362 --> 00:29:46,820
Using helmets or putting seat belts
after seeing a police man,

329
00:29:46,999 --> 00:29:49,331
and if they catch, without
making claims of high connections,

330
00:29:49,501 --> 00:29:51,662
and escaping from them...
follow the rules!

331
00:29:51,837 --> 00:29:52,826
So now...

332
00:29:54,506 --> 00:29:55,734
...listen to a song!

333
00:31:14,619 --> 00:31:17,952
Rs.1,500 crores are burning to ashes!

334
00:31:18,123 --> 00:31:20,523
l stole it is risking my life.

335
00:31:33,138 --> 00:31:37,598
Ravi! l'll not spare you!

336
00:31:40,779 --> 00:31:42,303
Sir...you?

337
00:31:47,319 --> 00:31:48,980
Bittu has escaped!

338
00:31:49,154 --> 00:31:51,213
He killed Prabhu and 3 constables.

339
00:31:52,491 --> 00:31:54,891
You're the next target!

340
00:32:01,967 --> 00:32:05,630
To protect witnesses from criminals,

341
00:32:05,804 --> 00:32:07,465
we change their names and
send them to new places.

342
00:32:07,639 --> 00:32:10,164
We call it as witness
re-location program.

343
00:32:10,342 --> 00:32:12,674
You'll be away from your family
for about 4 or 5 months.

344
00:32:12,811 --> 00:32:14,506
As soon as we catch Bittu,
you can come back.

345
00:32:14,679 --> 00:32:17,580
You'd say something, right father?
Say it father.

346
00:32:20,352 --> 00:32:23,583
l want you to come good in life,
that's why l scolded at you.

347
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:28,250
Now all l want you is to stay alive.
That's all!

348
00:32:32,197 --> 00:32:34,324
lt's not your father's anger,
he's worried about...

349
00:32:34,499 --> 00:32:37,991
Nothing Sir, he's frustrated for
losing Rs.5 lakhs deposited in bank.

350
00:32:38,203 --> 00:32:41,832
l'll talk to him after earning back
those Rs.5 lakhs in these 5 months.

351
00:32:42,007 --> 00:32:45,534
l'll go to Australia
or Dubai, send me there.

352
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:47,541
We don't have that much budget,

353
00:32:47,712 --> 00:32:51,705
at the most we can
send you to Hyderabad. - Hyderabad?

354
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:53,540
To put me in a bus and
send me to Hyderabad,

355
00:32:53,718 --> 00:32:57,210
why do you use terms like
're-location program' Sir?

356
00:32:57,389 --> 00:33:00,051
A man who can escape from jail
can't he come to Hyderabad?

357
00:33:00,225 --> 00:33:01,385
No...
- l beg you Sir.

358
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:04,051
This will not work out,
l think you'll kill me before Bittu.

359
00:33:04,229 --> 00:33:05,696
Do you trust me Sir?

360
00:33:05,897 --> 00:33:08,195
l've a program. Let's follow that.
- Okay, come.

361
00:33:08,366 --> 00:33:11,529
First time my photo is coming in
newspaper, tell him to take it well.

362
00:33:11,703 --> 00:33:14,035
Why an expression for
an accident photo?

363
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:17,031
Logic Sir, l'll look serious.

364
00:33:17,876 --> 00:33:19,639
Dead man has no expression.

365
00:33:20,745 --> 00:33:23,236
You're right Sir, l'll look dead,
tell him to take the snap.

366
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:28,082
l don't know if children get maths
or not if my father beats them,

367
00:33:28,253 --> 00:33:32,246
but if Bittu hits my father
will tell everything. That's why!

368
00:33:32,424 --> 00:33:36,758
But if l'm dead, Bittu would relax
and mind his work.

369
00:33:36,928 --> 00:33:39,726
My batch mate Seetharam is
in Hyderabad. My good friend.

370
00:33:39,898 --> 00:33:41,729
l've told him you're coming
there in search of ajob.

371
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:44,391
Stay with him but
don't tell about Bittu.

372
00:33:44,569 --> 00:33:46,059
He's a coward!

373
00:33:51,443 --> 00:33:53,274
What happened?

374
00:33:53,445 --> 00:33:57,279
He died before l could kill him.

375
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:06,955
He's vey lucky.

376
00:34:07,125 --> 00:34:10,617
ACP Seetharam's residence
Banjara Hills, Hyderabad

377
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:19,298
ln all these years of my service
never got an opportunity to use it.

378
00:34:19,471 --> 00:34:20,460
You blessed me like that.

379
00:34:20,605 --> 00:34:22,937
Nothing is impossible for you.

380
00:34:27,312 --> 00:34:28,802
Keep that bell.

381
00:34:29,814 --> 00:34:31,145
How did you know it Sir?

382
00:34:31,316 --> 00:34:33,648
lt's a bell, can't you hear
the sound when you walk?

383
00:34:36,154 --> 00:34:38,315
To ring the bell, like this.

384
00:34:38,490 --> 00:34:40,151
lf you want to steal, like this!

385
00:34:40,325 --> 00:34:42,657
Sir, you're a police officer,

386
00:34:42,827 --> 00:34:46,126
had you been a thief
nobody could've caught you. Bye Sir.

387
00:34:47,799 --> 00:34:50,324
You said you've to go to station
to pick up someone.

388
00:34:51,136 --> 00:34:54,503
Train arrives at 8.30 am!
Plenty of time.

389
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:55,970
l can have breakfast too by then.

390
00:34:56,141 --> 00:34:58,837
Excuse me, where's the common bathroom?
- That side.

391
00:35:02,514 --> 00:35:04,175
Who is he?
- Who knows?

392
00:35:14,526 --> 00:35:15,356
Oh no 8.45 am!
l need to go to railway station.

393
00:35:15,527 --> 00:35:17,518
No need. l'm coming from there.

394
00:35:18,029 --> 00:35:19,155
Yes.

395
00:35:19,497 --> 00:35:20,156
l can see.

396
00:35:20,332 --> 00:35:22,357
l and Rajamanikyam...
- He told me.

397
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,831
This address...
- l found it.

398
00:35:24,002 --> 00:35:26,163
Coffee?
- l'll have it. - Later.

399
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:29,170
No problem, l'll come.

400
00:35:30,008 --> 00:35:32,533
He's Ravi, he looks average.

401
00:35:32,711 --> 00:35:34,702
Go inside and talk.
Wire may get snapped.

402
00:35:36,881 --> 00:35:39,042
My eldest daughter.
- Good Sir.

403
00:35:39,217 --> 00:35:41,208
l know, don't ogle at her.

404
00:35:41,386 --> 00:35:45,220
l've already fixed her marriage,
bridegroom is a pilot.

405
00:35:45,724 --> 00:35:47,715
lf you want go out with him
as much as you want.

406
00:35:48,893 --> 00:35:50,053
She's my wife Lalitha.

407
00:35:50,228 --> 00:35:54,528
The one who left angrily is Neha, the one
who didn't come out feeling shy is Ooha.

408
00:35:54,699 --> 00:35:55,529
Then what about him?

409
00:35:56,701 --> 00:35:59,192
So, yours is a big family!

410
00:36:00,705 --> 00:36:03,196
He's...
- Thief!

411
00:36:03,408 --> 00:36:04,568
How do you know it?
- l can smell him.

412
00:36:04,743 --> 00:36:06,040
He stole my perfume bottle.

413
00:36:08,913 --> 00:36:11,404
Sorry, he's an ex-thief.

414
00:36:11,583 --> 00:36:14,746
His specialty is to get
caught in a minute.

415
00:36:14,919 --> 00:36:17,251
Snatch chain!

416
00:36:19,257 --> 00:36:22,090
Thief...thief...bloody...
may you lose your hands!

417
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:24,251
Sorry, your chain got stuck in my hand.

418
00:36:25,897 --> 00:36:28,127
Steal money!

419
00:36:28,566 --> 00:36:31,899
Hey oldie! What's that look?

420
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:34,061
Keep the bag down!

421
00:36:35,607 --> 00:36:36,767
Open the zip you fool!

422
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:55,783
Nobody offered him ajob,
so l had to keep him here.

423
00:36:57,295 --> 00:36:58,125
Who is she?

424
00:36:58,296 --> 00:37:00,264
l told you she's my youngest daughter.

425
00:37:00,765 --> 00:37:01,754
What's her age?

426
00:37:03,601 --> 00:37:05,466
Were you still working then?

427
00:37:06,638 --> 00:37:08,105
What are you saying before women?

428
00:37:08,273 --> 00:37:09,934
Why is the entire family
in the hall brother-in-law?

429
00:37:11,476 --> 00:37:13,967
Bedroom is not empty.
- Cool brother-in-law.

430
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:17,639
How many times l've told you
not to bring criminals to home?

431
00:37:17,816 --> 00:37:21,149
My jeep broke down on the way to station,
l thought you'd give me lift.

432
00:37:21,319 --> 00:37:22,479
Are you going fine brother?

433
00:37:22,654 --> 00:37:24,815
Would you like to have coffee?
- Get him a biryani too.

434
00:37:24,989 --> 00:37:26,650
Don't know who you should
ask for a coffee, go in!!

435
00:37:26,825 --> 00:37:28,315
ls it wrong to ask for coffee too?
- What's the case?

436
00:37:28,493 --> 00:37:30,654
He stole a gold chain
from Commissioner's house.

437
00:37:30,829 --> 00:37:33,297
l've tried third degree but he's
refusing to tell where he hid it.

438
00:37:33,465 --> 00:37:35,296
For you too?
- Who is he Sir?

439
00:37:36,301 --> 00:37:39,293
He's Valmiki, great Cl!

440
00:37:40,138 --> 00:37:41,969
lnterrogation specialist.

441
00:37:42,841 --> 00:37:46,299
He make even dreaded
criminals to cry!

442
00:37:46,511 --> 00:37:49,173
Brother-in-law, please no,
we mustn't praise ourselves.

443
00:37:49,347 --> 00:37:53,681
lf he hasn't told you too means...
- l'm unable to get it.

444
00:37:53,852 --> 00:37:57,686
l used belts, chains, batons,
pins and safety pins too!

445
00:38:05,029 --> 00:38:06,496
Since Commissioner wasn't
paying for the chain,

446
00:38:06,664 --> 00:38:09,326
the jeweller who sold it
asked me to steal it for him.

447
00:38:10,168 --> 00:38:12,602
You'd have tried everything
but not the pin.

448
00:38:17,709 --> 00:38:23,045
Please show him flowers and girls!
He's too violent!

449
00:38:36,394 --> 00:38:38,885
Would anyone eat flowers?
- Aren't we eating cauliflower?

450
00:38:43,201 --> 00:38:45,032
You'll become fate if you
eat clarified butter.

451
00:38:45,203 --> 00:38:46,727
Was my mother fat?

452
00:38:47,038 --> 00:38:50,735
Your aunt loves you so much
as her own daughter.

453
00:38:54,746 --> 00:38:56,077
Lifebouy!

454
00:38:56,247 --> 00:38:59,410
Neither l've a life nor
my life has a boy!

455
00:39:03,922 --> 00:39:07,915
Why are you still standing
behind the curtain? Come out!

456
00:39:08,092 --> 00:39:09,923
l'm standing outside father.

457
00:39:16,234 --> 00:39:18,668
Be careful dear, there are
many colleges in this route.

458
00:39:19,237 --> 00:39:23,071
Who would look at me father?
- There will be some mad man!

459
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,441
Where uncle?
- Cricket betting takes place near by...

460
00:39:31,616 --> 00:39:32,446
Betting?

461
00:39:32,617 --> 00:39:34,778
Come uncle, need Rs.5 lakhs urgently.
- Rs.5 lakhs?

462
00:39:34,953 --> 00:39:37,615
Don't worry about amount,
l've good experience in this.

463
00:39:37,789 --> 00:39:40,451
With such idea only Singapore
Lakshminarayana invested Rs.50,000.

464
00:39:40,625 --> 00:39:41,455
Didn't he get money?

465
00:39:41,626 --> 00:39:44,117
Why not? He got money
and l got experience.

466
00:40:04,983 --> 00:40:06,314
What a figure!

467
00:40:08,653 --> 00:40:09,483
What's there?

468
00:40:09,988 --> 00:40:12,149
Wind must blow if you want to see her.

469
00:40:12,323 --> 00:40:14,382
Whether wind blows or cyclone hits,
it remains the same.

470
00:40:16,661 --> 00:40:18,652
Did you see?
lt twinkled when she smiled!

471
00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:20,457
Lightning? lt'll rain too!

472
00:40:20,632 --> 00:40:22,293
l want to go to her at once uncle.

473
00:40:22,467 --> 00:40:24,367
No need, she'll come if we call her.

474
00:40:37,515 --> 00:40:38,743
You are...?

475
00:40:53,998 --> 00:40:57,832
Just a while ago there was
a twinkle when you smiled.

476
00:40:58,002 --> 00:40:59,697
May be because of this.

477
00:41:01,506 --> 00:41:02,165
Come here!

478
00:41:02,874 --> 00:41:04,705
Why are her teeth having
a fence like for fields?

479
00:41:04,876 --> 00:41:05,501
lsn't she cute?

480
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:08,873
He has gone completely blind.
l think l'll go my own.

481
00:41:09,047 --> 00:41:09,706
l got a scapegoat.

482
00:41:10,214 --> 00:41:12,705
How can l reach Koti Sir?
- That side.

483
00:41:13,051 --> 00:41:14,040
l don't have work there.

484
00:41:20,224 --> 00:41:21,452
l got it.

485
00:41:30,735 --> 00:41:32,362
What does your father?

486
00:41:32,537 --> 00:41:34,027
He married second time.

487
00:41:37,208 --> 00:41:39,733
Your mother..?
- She's dead.

488
00:41:40,244 --> 00:41:42,144
Sorry...

489
00:41:43,081 --> 00:41:47,575
Your step mother...?
- She tortures me. What else?

490
00:41:48,586 --> 00:41:49,917
Lousy family!

491
00:41:53,257 --> 00:41:54,918
Shall we've a tea?

492
00:41:56,594 --> 00:41:59,427
lt's cool raining,
hot tea would be fine.

493
00:42:01,566 --> 00:42:02,464
lt'll be fine.

494
00:42:10,108 --> 00:42:14,568
We can have tea before bus arrives.

495
00:42:15,947 --> 00:42:17,107
Bus has arrived.

496
00:42:22,954 --> 00:42:24,785
You didn't tell me your name...

497
00:42:47,979 --> 00:42:49,970
By the way you didn't tell me your name.

498
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:27,015
O Madhu, my heart isn't
mine anymore...

499
00:43:27,185 --> 00:43:32,179
O Madhu, my heart is
no more with me...

500
00:43:32,356 --> 00:43:37,191
You're spread magic with your eyes
moving like a merry-go-round...

501
00:43:37,361 --> 00:43:42,162
With your magnetic beauty
made Hyderabad go after you...

502
00:43:42,333 --> 00:43:47,168
l've left myself and come to you,
anyway my heart won't come back to me...

503
00:43:47,338 --> 00:43:49,169
Even if it comes,
what would l do with it?

504
00:43:49,340 --> 00:43:52,366
So, keep it with you,
l don't want it...

505
00:44:22,373 --> 00:44:29,575
Every drop of the rain shows
you like a mirror...

506
00:44:32,416 --> 00:44:39,913
When my father shouts at me,
every word hears like your name...

507
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:47,720
Like a little with two plaits..
Like rainbow sporting different colours...

508
00:44:47,899 --> 00:44:52,996
You look different in different angle and
tempted and killed me like a live wire...

509
00:45:05,783 --> 00:45:06,943
Madhu boss...

510
00:45:08,953 --> 00:45:09,942
Madhu friend...

511
00:45:10,788 --> 00:45:12,278
Madhu future...

512
00:45:13,624 --> 00:45:16,957
ls she that beautiful?
- Class Sir!

513
00:45:17,128 --> 00:45:18,618
Then, she must be dull.

514
00:45:18,796 --> 00:45:20,286
Active girl Sir.

515
00:45:21,933 --> 00:45:23,594
Then long skirt and jacket type.

516
00:45:23,768 --> 00:45:25,429
She was wearing churidhar.

517
00:45:26,270 --> 00:45:29,262
Which good looking girl
now wears churidhar?

518
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:32,466
What are you saying?
Why do you always negative?

519
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:33,770
Can you blabber anything
if you're drunk?

520
00:45:33,978 --> 00:45:36,310
Bloody old generation!

521
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:39,142
l just asked if she's good looking,
why is he getting irritated?

522
00:45:39,317 --> 00:45:42,809
May be she's not that beautiful,
why are inquiring and irritating him?

523
00:45:42,987 --> 00:45:45,478
Yuck! Both father and daughter
don't have any taste.

524
00:45:46,824 --> 00:45:48,485
He's gone, right? Go study!

525
00:45:48,659 --> 00:45:50,991
l'm seeing you here only,
what do you do?

526
00:45:51,162 --> 00:45:52,493
What would l do?

527
00:45:52,663 --> 00:45:55,791
No jobs in software and
no growth in hardware.

528
00:45:55,967 --> 00:45:59,300
Goons rule real estate,
low salaries in contractions.

529
00:45:59,470 --> 00:46:02,997
lf l commit myself in hurry,
l'd be like that in 10 years.

530
00:46:04,175 --> 00:46:06,166
ln 20 years end up like that.

531
00:46:33,337 --> 00:46:35,032
At least before bus arrives...

532
00:46:38,042 --> 00:46:39,669
21C goes to your office, right?

533
00:46:39,844 --> 00:46:41,368
l'm going out for shopping.

534
00:46:43,547 --> 00:46:46,539
Can't she invite me?
- Girls will not invite.

535
00:47:23,087 --> 00:47:30,493
Your waist is thin like pipe making
other girls jealous of it...

536
00:47:33,097 --> 00:47:41,095
Even if Lord Brahma offers personal
apology, l can't forgive him...

537
00:47:43,574 --> 00:47:48,443
Like a moon spilling sandalwood...
Like jasmine spreading numbing fragrance...

538
00:47:48,612 --> 00:47:53,948
You're tempting and killing me
differently at different times...

539
00:48:25,649 --> 00:48:26,809
Why do you think so much for it?

540
00:48:26,984 --> 00:48:29,475
Change the daughter's make up and
say she eloped with neighbour boy.

541
00:48:29,653 --> 00:48:31,484
We can stretch it for
another 30 episodes.

542
00:48:32,490 --> 00:48:33,980
Daughter's get has changed completely.

543
00:48:37,828 --> 00:48:39,318
How much did you spend on it?

544
00:48:41,632 --> 00:48:42,792
Rs.150!

545
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:45,291
How could you spend
Rs.25,000 for shopping?- l didn't Sir.

546
00:48:46,971 --> 00:48:48,461
How did he leave you
without payment?

547
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:50,800
l'm ACP Seetharam's relative,
you know that?

548
00:48:50,975 --> 00:48:52,806
So, they left you after
taking my name, right?

549
00:48:52,977 --> 00:48:55,172
No.
- Then?

550
00:48:55,346 --> 00:48:57,177
He'll come personally and pay.

551
00:48:57,348 --> 00:49:00,579
So, you've pledged me, right?

552
00:49:11,362 --> 00:49:16,322
Down with Varadarajulu!
- Stop it!

553
00:49:17,668 --> 00:49:19,192
How much did you invest?
- 10!

554
00:49:19,370 --> 00:49:20,564
Mine is 50!

555
00:49:21,372 --> 00:49:22,896
Would they pay if you shout?

556
00:49:23,374 --> 00:49:24,841
What are you looking at?...

557
00:49:25,009 --> 00:49:26,840
Will you beat me?
Come beat me.

558
00:49:27,378 --> 00:49:29,710
Not just your 10 but 12 years of...

559
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:31,871
How could they let Bittu
escape so easily?

560
00:49:32,049 --> 00:49:34,540
Have you gone blind?...

561
00:49:34,718 --> 00:49:36,879
What is this? Khaddar!

562
00:49:37,054 --> 00:49:38,885
What's that? Khaki!

563
00:49:39,056 --> 00:49:42,719
Ask him that question!
Come on ask him! Ask him!

564
00:49:43,394 --> 00:49:45,555
Next time they'll strip
your uniform and beat you.

565
00:49:47,531 --> 00:49:49,362
Tell that in Telugu to them!

566
00:49:51,035 --> 00:49:55,028
Bittu's two men broke signals
on the night of robbery,

567
00:49:55,239 --> 00:49:57,400
electronic cameras have
taken their pictures,

568
00:50:00,744 --> 00:50:03,736
we've sent those photographs too
to all stations along with Bittu's.

569
00:50:04,915 --> 00:50:06,576
Now we're releasing it
to the press also.

570
00:50:20,397 --> 00:50:22,957
lt would be fine if you join me
for the press meet too.

571
00:50:24,068 --> 00:50:26,559
lf you send us out of country,
we'll not come here too.

572
00:50:27,905 --> 00:50:30,601
Murthy, send them out immediately.

573
00:50:30,908 --> 00:50:33,274
They're coming to guest house
for a group photo session.

574
00:50:33,444 --> 00:50:36,106
Making fake passports isn't easy Sir.

575
00:50:36,280 --> 00:50:37,611
They didn't bring the money anyway.

576
00:50:37,781 --> 00:50:41,114
Tell him to send at least his group's
photos, fake names and addresses.

577
00:50:41,285 --> 00:50:44,118
He wants you to submit applications,
who are you sending to him?

578
00:50:52,129 --> 00:50:54,256
Name is Sattar, six feet tall!

579
00:50:54,431 --> 00:50:55,921
How tall would he be sitting?

580
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:58,591
l know your intelligence,
that's why l sent him your photo.

581
00:50:58,769 --> 00:51:02,296
He'll find you, he'll give you
a cover, take it properly.

582
00:51:08,946 --> 00:51:10,811
Sattar is here, get ready.

583
00:51:44,181 --> 00:51:46,672
Sattar, don't do anything in haste.

584
00:51:46,850 --> 00:51:47,839
Let me go away!

585
00:51:49,353 --> 00:51:51,344
lf not l'll kill this girl.

586
00:51:51,522 --> 00:51:54,855
We're consulting high officials,
they'll be here.

587
00:51:55,025 --> 00:51:58,517
They'll consider your demands.
We need little time.

588
00:51:59,029 --> 00:51:59,859
What's the situation?

589
00:52:00,030 --> 00:52:01,657
About 100 students are inside.

590
00:52:04,835 --> 00:52:06,666
ls he alive?

591
00:52:07,671 --> 00:52:09,161
Luckily, nothing happened!

592
00:52:13,711 --> 00:52:14,541
What happened Sir?

593
00:52:19,216 --> 00:52:21,707
What happened?
- You shot him down!

594
00:52:23,721 --> 00:52:25,552
l shot him.
- How?

595
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:32,051
Remove your glasses,
can't get your expression.

596
00:52:47,911 --> 00:52:49,401
Do you know shooting?

597
00:52:50,414 --> 00:52:51,745
You don't need training for it Sir.

598
00:52:51,915 --> 00:52:54,577
All you need is a trigger
and a head to be shot.

599
00:52:54,752 --> 00:52:58,153
There are handcuffs and jails too!

600
00:52:59,590 --> 00:53:02,423
To remove bacteria from bathroom,
you've to use acid.

601
00:53:02,593 --> 00:53:03,423
You don't use scent.

602
00:53:03,594 --> 00:53:06,586
Why are you discussing with a
criminal threatening to kill children?

603
00:53:06,764 --> 00:53:08,391
Why don't you just gun them down?

604
00:53:09,566 --> 00:53:11,557
What's your comment on this incident Sir?

605
00:53:13,237 --> 00:53:18,140
lt was a sudden incident,
nobody could imagine it.

606
00:53:18,609 --> 00:53:22,943
ln such situations...
tell them to get his body!

607
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:25,446
Brother-in-law, tell them
to get the body.- Okay.

608
00:53:25,616 --> 00:53:29,108
What's this like a kid?

609
00:53:29,286 --> 00:53:32,949
You should've seen when he shot him,
my heart froze!

610
00:53:33,123 --> 00:53:35,114
He shot him down suddenly, bloody rogue!

611
00:53:36,627 --> 00:53:41,587
Evening when l dozed off, had a
dream of getting President's medal.

612
00:53:41,765 --> 00:53:44,256
lsn't it good if you get
the President's medal?

613
00:53:44,468 --> 00:53:46,459
But it was you who was accepting it.

614
00:53:56,313 --> 00:53:58,804
Never used the gun in
my 25 years of service.

615
00:53:58,982 --> 00:54:00,973
No? l'll make you also use it Sir.

616
00:54:01,985 --> 00:54:03,646
l'll not fire till l'm alive.

617
00:54:04,488 --> 00:54:08,322
l'm a Gandhian,
come let's have a drink.

618
00:54:08,492 --> 00:54:10,824
Till now you shouted at him and
want him to join for a drink now.

619
00:54:10,994 --> 00:54:13,485
Just because you're scared,
do we stop watching horror films?

620
00:54:13,664 --> 00:54:15,962
That's a bad habit!
He too is one of them.

621
00:54:40,023 --> 00:54:43,186
You made a film and used
my brother-in-law's poster.- Keep quiet.

622
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:47,194
We got his office travel papers
from Sattar's body.

623
00:54:47,331 --> 00:54:50,528
First time in life my brother-in-law
is trying to interrogate him.

624
00:54:50,667 --> 00:54:53,329
l don't think he's that successful,
take a look!

625
00:54:53,704 --> 00:54:56,696
lf anyone has my letterhead,
would you call me to the station?

626
00:54:56,874 --> 00:54:59,707
Many hundreds come to my office
seeking passports every day.

627
00:55:00,711 --> 00:55:02,702
lt is you who must find
the criminals among them.

628
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:05,872
You shoot because you've gun and
call here because you've an office.

629
00:55:06,049 --> 00:55:08,882
Do you've sense? Some useless man
is shouting at him, why are you silent?

630
00:55:10,053 --> 00:55:10,712
He got angry, so he's shouting.

631
00:55:10,888 --> 00:55:13,220
l'm frustrated now, can l beat up
that Travel Murthy's man?

632
00:55:13,390 --> 00:55:16,052
You bet him. l'll take care of it.
- Hold this.

633
00:55:26,203 --> 00:55:28,933
Has my table got so many deadly weapons?

634
00:55:31,375 --> 00:55:32,364
What's the trouble here?

635
00:55:32,743 --> 00:55:34,574
What's this?
Why is he beating him?

636
00:55:34,745 --> 00:55:36,906
You don't need reason to beat criminals.

637
00:55:38,248 --> 00:55:41,581
He's my man!
- Who said you're men? Who?

638
00:55:41,752 --> 00:55:42,582
What's this Sir?

639
00:55:42,753 --> 00:55:45,916
Frustration Sir! lt seems the poor
man lost his bike. He's frustrated!

640
00:55:46,089 --> 00:55:47,078
Can you get back your bike
if you beat him?

641
00:55:47,257 --> 00:55:48,918
He'll get over the frustration, right?

642
00:55:51,929 --> 00:55:54,397
What's the trouble?

643
00:55:54,565 --> 00:55:57,591
Frustration Sir, lt seems our people
are not taking his complaint.

644
00:55:58,735 --> 00:56:01,602
Please look after it.
- He's beating up my man!

645
00:56:02,773 --> 00:56:05,401
Look after that also.
- That's what we're looking at Sir!

646
00:56:05,609 --> 00:56:07,099
lt seems he's looking at it!

647
00:56:08,946 --> 00:56:12,609
l got it Sir,
he's beating him up wantonly.

648
00:56:14,117 --> 00:56:16,278
You're supporting him.

649
00:56:17,454 --> 00:56:20,617
Neither it's frustration nor my foot!
- This is realization!

650
00:56:22,125 --> 00:56:24,787
l'll take care of you!

651
00:56:27,764 --> 00:56:31,928
That's it Sir! You think l'm a boy
and can't do anything, right?

652
00:56:32,102 --> 00:56:34,798
Can't do anything?
You've almost killed them.

653
00:56:35,939 --> 00:56:39,102
What have you done about
the passports Murthy?

654
00:56:39,276 --> 00:56:41,642
What can l do Sir?
Finding my letterhead with Sattar,

655
00:56:41,812 --> 00:56:43,279
police are turning heat on me.

656
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:46,040
l can't help you in this matter.
Sorry Sir, please leave me.

657
00:56:50,153 --> 00:56:54,487
Somebody is trying to stop me.
Who is he?

658
00:57:00,464 --> 00:57:04,798
He has become a headache to you,
l'm sure he'd be epitome of pain.

659
00:57:04,968 --> 00:57:07,459
Why is his photo here?
- Do you know him?

660
00:57:08,138 --> 00:57:11,130
l came to Hyderabad from Vizag
for helping to arrest him.

661
00:57:13,844 --> 00:57:17,507
ln Rs.1,500 crore crime,

662
00:57:17,681 --> 00:57:21,344
he's accused number one and
are you the witness number one?

663
00:57:21,518 --> 00:57:24,681
With police vigilance around
going out of lndia...

664
00:57:24,855 --> 00:57:26,686
He mustn't go out of this
country at any cost.

665
00:57:26,857 --> 00:57:29,849
lf l get scared and stop,
l may never escape.

666
00:57:30,027 --> 00:57:31,688
Why are you so stubborn?

667
00:57:31,862 --> 00:57:34,660
lt's stubbornness but ego!

668
00:57:34,831 --> 00:57:36,492
Why do you want to take the risk?

669
00:57:36,667 --> 00:57:38,498
lt's not risk but ego!

670
00:57:38,702 --> 00:57:42,331
He made me to garland my photo
and offer obsequies while l'm alive.

671
00:57:42,506 --> 00:57:46,033
Would l spare him?
l'll surely catch him.

672
00:57:46,209 --> 00:57:48,200
Nobody can catch me.

673
00:57:48,345 --> 00:57:52,441
l'll slip out like sand
from a clenching fist!

674
00:57:53,050 --> 00:57:59,046
lf l clench my fist, even sand
can't escape and die in my hand.

675
00:57:59,222 --> 00:58:00,712
Call Home Minister and tell them
not to touch Travel Murthy.

676
00:58:04,061 --> 00:58:06,723
DGP. tell your boys not
to touch Travel Murthy.

677
00:58:06,897 --> 00:58:09,024
Why are you torturing Murthy?
Leave him. lt's all over!

678
00:58:09,199 --> 00:58:13,192
l'm telling you to drop
the matter here itself. Got it?

679
00:58:16,373 --> 00:58:17,533
Our DGP!

680
00:58:17,741 --> 00:58:20,073
Travel Murthy is great man,

681
00:58:20,243 --> 00:58:24,737
if possible felicitate him but
don't call him to station.

682
00:58:25,248 --> 00:58:28,081
lf we get evidence that Murthy
is helping Bittu to get passport,

683
00:58:28,251 --> 00:58:29,741
what can DGP also do?

684
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:33,412
Morning he'd do Yoga and
evening he'd take a walk.

685
00:58:33,590 --> 00:58:36,582
How can l know what would
he do if get evidence?

686
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:38,591
ls it so easy to get
evidence against him?

687
00:58:38,762 --> 00:58:41,731
What?
- Madhu works with Murthy's office!

688
00:58:41,898 --> 00:58:44,059
So what?
- lf we hold Madhu keycard,

689
00:58:44,234 --> 00:58:48,398
we can get information of Bittu's
ticket and how it'll hand reach him.

690
00:58:48,572 --> 00:58:51,234
lf we get those documents,
we can arrest both of them.

691
00:58:51,408 --> 00:58:52,932
Why would she give the key card?

692
00:58:53,110 --> 00:58:55,943
Give me two water tanks and a Bluetooth,
in 3 days, she'll do as l say!

693
00:59:21,271 --> 00:59:23,967
Neither rain will stop nor bus
would come till we finish the tea.

694
00:59:25,442 --> 00:59:25,965
Stop!

695
00:59:26,810 --> 00:59:27,504
Brother-in-law!

696
00:59:29,813 --> 00:59:31,303
Bus has been stopped.

697
00:59:31,481 --> 00:59:33,142
We can hold it for 10 minutes only.

698
00:59:33,316 --> 00:59:34,476
Why did you stop the bus Sir?

699
00:59:34,985 --> 00:59:37,146
Why?
- For public safety!

700
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:40,312
All of you please co-operate with us.
Think he's a terrorist.

701
00:59:41,324 --> 00:59:43,155
Just assume!
- Please sit down!

702
00:59:43,994 --> 00:59:47,794
lf anyone talks l'll blow this
bus to smithereens!

703
00:59:47,964 --> 00:59:49,955
Throw away your cell phones.

704
00:59:55,639 --> 01:00:01,009
Throw means outside not on him!
Will you kill the boy?

705
01:00:01,645 --> 01:00:03,169
lsn't it good if a terrorist dies?

706
01:00:04,681 --> 01:00:08,173
Now he's not a terrorist but a thief!

707
01:00:09,186 --> 01:00:14,681
Now he'll burn down the bus
and threaten you with a knife.

708
01:00:15,525 --> 01:00:17,015
What would you do?

709
01:00:22,666 --> 01:00:24,327
What will you do man?

710
01:00:24,501 --> 01:00:26,560
l'll cut his hand and douse the fire.

711
01:00:29,339 --> 01:00:32,672
You can blow it like this and
hand him over to police too.

712
01:00:32,876 --> 01:00:34,673
You've that option too, you know?
Sit down.

713
01:00:35,679 --> 01:00:39,877
Rain will stop now...stop...
it has stopped!

714
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:45,210
What about my bus?

715
01:00:45,388 --> 01:00:48,380
Driver, Commissioner's daughter will
board the bus at next stopping.

716
01:00:48,558 --> 01:00:51,721
Doesn't she have a car?
- Gone for repairs.

717
01:00:52,395 --> 01:00:55,523
An officer in red shirt
will help her to board.

718
01:00:55,699 --> 01:00:57,360
Doesn't he have a uniform?

719
01:01:00,370 --> 01:01:01,701
Gave it for washing!

720
01:01:02,372 --> 01:01:04,897
Bus must move once he signals.

721
01:01:05,242 --> 01:01:10,236
lf people are so violent,
how can the poor criminals live?

722
01:01:10,413 --> 01:01:12,244
l'm also thinking about it.

723
01:01:12,415 --> 01:01:15,407
Look, your bus hasn't come yet.
- Your luck!

724
01:01:15,919 --> 01:01:18,911
Do you know what luck is?
Luck is what you wish!

725
01:01:19,089 --> 01:01:20,750
What you desire is future!

726
01:01:21,758 --> 01:01:24,249
Really?
- Why not try it?

727
01:01:25,762 --> 01:01:26,922
Make a wish!

728
01:01:28,732 --> 01:01:30,393
l don't like to go in a bus!

729
01:01:37,941 --> 01:01:40,933
Look, bus went away.
That is your power.

730
01:01:41,278 --> 01:01:44,941
Power? Do you know how much trouble
we took to stop the bus?

731
01:01:45,115 --> 01:01:46,104
Make another wish!

732
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:50,450
l want to ride on a bike.

733
01:01:50,620 --> 01:01:54,112
Bike? ls it chocolate?
How can l get one now?

734
01:01:54,291 --> 01:01:58,125
Don't tell him not to
commit on colour.

735
01:01:58,295 --> 01:01:59,125
Keep this.
- Just Rs.10?

736
01:01:59,296 --> 01:02:02,754
No change Sir.
- l too don't want change.- No Sir...

737
01:02:02,933 --> 01:02:05,595
Pay Rs.200 and run over the lemons,
nobody can stop you.

738
01:02:05,769 --> 01:02:08,761
lf l pay Rs.20 and stamp it with leg,
would God apply my bike's brakes?

739
01:02:08,972 --> 01:02:12,601
Mad man! Can a swimming pool have
Tsunami or God come to save you?

740
01:02:12,776 --> 01:02:15,142
That's why we're here.
- Do you've the RC book?

741
01:02:17,147 --> 01:02:18,307
lf you want this back,

742
01:02:18,481 --> 01:02:19,641
there's a boy in red shirt next street,

743
01:02:19,816 --> 01:02:22,808
give the bike to him and come tomorrow.
- Why should l give him?

744
01:02:22,986 --> 01:02:26,649
Split the bike's parts
saying it has a bomb,

745
01:02:26,823 --> 01:02:30,987
as usual say sorry to him,
and give those parts to him!

746
01:02:31,161 --> 01:02:32,321
Wrong Sir.
- Why?

747
01:02:32,495 --> 01:02:35,953
He can't carry all the parts,
keep the engine with you Sir.

748
01:02:36,132 --> 01:02:38,623
Which colour shirt he's wearing?
- Red!

749
01:02:44,641 --> 01:02:46,336
You're the red shirt guy, right?

750
01:02:58,021 --> 01:02:59,181
Happy?

751
01:03:00,357 --> 01:03:02,188
What if it rains now?

752
01:03:02,359 --> 01:03:05,021
Rain again? No way!
We sent the tankers.

753
01:03:05,195 --> 01:03:09,325
Your office is in Abids, there will be cyclone
not just rain before we reach.

754
01:03:09,499 --> 01:03:14,334
Find water tankers in Abids boys!
lt must rain there now!

755
01:03:51,074 --> 01:03:56,569
Good bike is there...
Girl is beside me...

756
01:03:56,713 --> 01:04:01,082
Cool breeze is blowing...
lt's pulling me...

757
01:04:01,251 --> 01:04:06,086
You've little mad...
And l like it...

758
01:04:06,256 --> 01:04:11,421
l've fallen for you...
you're my king..

759
01:04:11,594 --> 01:04:16,554
Bike is speeding up...
Beauty is devastating...

760
01:04:16,733 --> 01:04:22,262
l'm going mad...
don't attack me with your sensuality...

761
01:04:42,625 --> 01:04:47,927
When l see your sexy waist...
l lose my control...

762
01:04:48,098 --> 01:04:53,126
lf you sit on the pillion,
my front wheel goes up in air...

763
01:04:53,303 --> 01:04:58,297
A little red from lips will make
your bike to ride without petrol...

764
01:04:58,475 --> 01:05:03,469
On seeing the sensuality of my body,
won't it speed off thousands of miles...

765
01:05:03,646 --> 01:05:08,982
Your smiling face broke my heart...

766
01:05:09,152 --> 01:05:13,987
Your perfume overwhelmed my nose...

767
01:05:14,157 --> 01:05:19,151
Youth has hit like typhoon...
Kissing mood is in the air...

768
01:05:19,329 --> 01:05:24,790
Just say yes and see,
you can't stand my speed...

769
01:06:00,670 --> 01:06:06,199
Are you a beautiful page from
the legendary Kalidas' poetry...

770
01:06:06,376 --> 01:06:11,541
Are you the intoxication that has
come out from Devadas' wine bottle...

771
01:06:11,714 --> 01:06:16,549
O handsome man, you're strong and
well built like Arnold...

772
01:06:16,719 --> 01:06:21,713
You're fast like the bullet coming
out from the gun of James Bond...

773
01:06:21,891 --> 01:06:32,233
Your springy black hair moved in air...
My heart jumped in joy around you...

774
01:06:32,368 --> 01:06:37,567
Heart beats in a rhythm...
Time to change gear of love chariot...

775
01:06:37,707 --> 01:06:42,940
Virgin mesmerism is hovering over me...
lt's quite natural in love...

776
01:07:22,785 --> 01:07:23,274
What's that?

777
01:07:23,453 --> 01:07:25,444
Acid to bend the window grills.

778
01:07:25,955 --> 01:07:29,618
Welder to cut the bent grills.
- Glasses?

779
01:07:29,792 --> 01:07:30,952
To keep away fire sparks.

780
01:07:31,127 --> 01:07:33,118
What for this?
- For good grip.

781
01:07:36,432 --> 01:07:38,593
This is plastic explosive,
am l right?

782
01:07:40,303 --> 01:07:41,770
What for this?
- For attitude!

783
01:07:42,772 --> 01:07:44,933
Whatever it is, thief is a thief!
- Yes.

784
01:07:46,476 --> 01:07:48,808
He seems like master thief!
- Come in!

785
01:08:08,131 --> 01:08:09,291
Madhu...

786
01:08:10,967 --> 01:08:12,457
Got anything?

787
01:08:12,635 --> 01:08:15,627
Bittu and Madhu's tickets are
booked for tomorrow's flight.

788
01:08:15,805 --> 01:08:17,500
To Dubai via Mumbai!
- For Madhu?

789
01:08:17,674 --> 01:08:19,972
ls she an accomplice in
the bank robbery?

790
01:08:20,143 --> 01:08:23,510
Cool Sir, she doesn't even know to ogle.
How can she rob a bank?

791
01:08:23,980 --> 01:08:27,677
Shall we arrest Travel Murthy?
He may tell something.

792
01:08:27,850 --> 01:08:30,182
To catch the rat,
you must bait with an onion.

793
01:08:30,353 --> 01:08:31,684
Come straight!

794
01:08:31,854 --> 01:08:35,017
lf we arrest Murthy, Bittu will escape.
We must first catch Bittu.

795
01:08:36,359 --> 01:08:38,190
Let's put Murthy's office
under observation.

796
01:08:38,361 --> 01:08:41,091
lf Bittu comes tomorrow,
let's arrest both of them together.

797
01:08:55,545 --> 01:08:57,069
Who ordered it and
why are you delivering it to me?

798
01:09:00,049 --> 01:09:02,540
Bittu?
- Where's my passport?

799
01:09:02,719 --> 01:09:03,447
Just a minute!

800
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:06,712
l've arranged a family too for you,
your wife has epilepsy.

801
01:09:06,889 --> 01:09:09,722
To get sympathy in airport security check.

802
01:09:09,892 --> 01:09:11,052
Bombay flight is at 3 pm!

803
01:09:11,227 --> 01:09:13,718
Dubai flight leaves by night from there.
Your tickets.

804
01:09:15,031 --> 01:09:16,020
Who is my wife?

805
01:09:18,868 --> 01:09:20,028
l didn't order it.

806
01:09:28,911 --> 01:09:29,400
What happened Madhu?

807
01:09:29,579 --> 01:09:31,911
What else? Dieting, eating less
and fainting!

808
01:09:32,081 --> 01:09:33,241
lt has become fashion.

809
01:09:33,583 --> 01:09:36,074
What are you looking?
Help to take her to hospital.

810
01:09:48,097 --> 01:09:49,064
What's that?

811
01:09:49,232 --> 01:09:52,895
Someone would've ordered pizza, bike delivery.
- Zoom it.

812
01:09:56,072 --> 01:09:58,768
Box should've pizzas,
why clothes are there?

813
01:10:01,077 --> 01:10:03,443
Didn't you get it?
Bittu was here uncle!

814
01:10:13,956 --> 01:10:15,116
Where's Madhu?

815
01:10:15,291 --> 01:10:17,191
She fell sick and
they took her to the hospital.

816
01:10:17,794 --> 01:10:19,785
Who? The pizza delivery boy?

817
01:10:23,766 --> 01:10:26,599
That's him! He took Madhu to escape!

818
01:10:26,769 --> 01:10:28,464
He has a ticket for 3 pm Bombay flight.

819
01:10:34,811 --> 01:10:36,642
Stop...tell where are you going?

820
01:10:43,820 --> 01:10:44,878
Why did you stop here?

821
01:10:49,659 --> 01:10:50,819
We must go to the right.

822
01:10:50,993 --> 01:10:52,654
Yourjob is over with
handing over the passport.

823
01:10:52,829 --> 01:10:54,956
lt's my problem
where l go and how!

824
01:10:55,131 --> 01:10:57,622
But to go to Dubai...
- l can travel from Bangalore too!

825
01:10:57,800 --> 01:11:00,667
l'll board a flight tonight from there.
- What should l do now?

826
01:11:04,674 --> 01:11:10,010
Never ask the other man in life,
what should l do?

827
01:11:11,848 --> 01:11:15,011
You must have clarity yourself.

828
01:11:20,022 --> 01:11:24,686
Stop...stop...we must take right.
Why are you tensed?

829
01:11:24,861 --> 01:11:27,022
Police have swarmed the airport.

830
01:11:27,196 --> 01:11:28,993
l'm sure he wouldn't go
to the airport.

831
01:11:30,500 --> 01:11:33,162
We've his car number.
Where can he go?

832
01:11:35,338 --> 01:11:39,536
Black colour Merc, 444,
trace it immediately

833
01:11:41,711 --> 01:11:45,374
lt's going on Chennai Highway,
take a U turn. Let's get him.

834
01:11:45,548 --> 01:11:49,211
No Sir. He sent few people to East Vizag and
some to West during the bank robbery,

835
01:11:49,385 --> 01:11:50,545
He robbed the bank in central Vizag.

836
01:11:50,720 --> 01:11:52,210
He's using the same pattern.

837
01:11:52,388 --> 01:11:56,552
Few people would go to airport,
few would be roaming on Chennai Highway,

838
01:11:56,726 --> 01:11:58,887
he would be whistling his
way to Bangalore.

839
01:11:59,061 --> 01:12:00,050
How can you be so sure?

840
01:12:00,229 --> 01:12:02,197
l'll make him say hello
to you in 5 minutes.

841
01:12:11,374 --> 01:12:15,071
Look there, Bittu's vehicles.
- How can you be so sure?

842
01:12:21,584 --> 01:12:23,415
Though we've given them
so many directions,

843
01:12:23,586 --> 01:12:25,577
how could the police get so
much intelligence to catch us?

844
01:12:27,256 --> 01:12:30,419
l don't get it!

845
01:12:36,566 --> 01:12:37,897
Hey, you're jumping lanes!

846
01:12:38,401 --> 01:12:39,663
Breaking traffic rules.

847
01:12:40,770 --> 01:12:41,759
Watch out!

848
01:12:51,948 --> 01:12:53,779
Drive carefully, we may die!

849
01:12:56,118 --> 01:13:00,111
Why are you banging him?
We may die man!

850
01:14:35,217 --> 01:14:37,117
This car man!

851
01:14:42,558 --> 01:14:43,889
Move...move...

852
01:14:45,227 --> 01:14:47,559
People may die!

853
01:14:49,699 --> 01:14:53,897
Please stop for a second,
l'll get down.

854
01:14:54,036 --> 01:14:55,526
l'll get killed!

855
01:16:18,821 --> 01:16:21,813
Will you kill me for her?

856
01:16:21,991 --> 01:16:24,152
Can you? Will you dare?

857
01:16:24,326 --> 01:16:28,285
ls it like killing my brother alone?

858
01:16:28,497 --> 01:16:31,295
Did you or your bother build
temples to live for 100 years?

859
01:16:31,467 --> 01:16:32,957
Bloody bank robbers!

860
01:16:33,135 --> 01:16:35,831
Any brother to you would die at 25!

861
01:16:36,005 --> 01:16:37,632
You'll also die in near future.

862
01:16:38,841 --> 01:16:42,333
Are you an astrologer
to predict my death?

863
01:16:43,345 --> 01:16:45,677
l'm telling your future now,

864
01:16:47,516 --> 01:16:51,008
l'll make you carry the
bodies of your entire family.

865
01:16:51,187 --> 01:16:55,681
Your shoulders must be strong.
- Don't worry about far away family.

866
01:16:56,025 --> 01:16:59,017
The girl at the end of
your gun barrel is my life.

867
01:16:59,195 --> 01:17:03,996
Your gun has ten bullets,
even if one bullet gets into her,

868
01:17:04,166 --> 01:17:06,498
if l don't shoot you dead before
you fire second bullet,

869
01:17:06,669 --> 01:17:07,863
l wasn't born to my father,
you bloody bastard!

870
01:17:08,037 --> 01:17:08,662
Eater's name is written
on every food grain.

871
01:17:08,871 --> 01:17:11,169
But the bullet that kills you
will have my name.

872
01:17:11,340 --> 01:17:14,673
Bittu, l'm Ravindra Narayan,
your wake up call to death!

873
01:17:14,877 --> 01:17:18,540
l'll kill you...
- Don't just threaten me, bloody!

874
01:17:18,714 --> 01:17:21,877
You fire one bullet,
l'll put entire magazine into you.

875
01:17:22,051 --> 01:17:25,043
Are you mad? The girl is
with him, he'll kill her.

876
01:17:25,221 --> 01:17:27,212
How long can we be mute
spectators fearing death?

877
01:17:27,389 --> 01:17:34,056
Fire...fire...let me see!
- Don't provoke him.

878
01:17:37,867 --> 01:17:39,198
He's wantonly provoking you.
- Why are you talking to her?

879
01:17:39,368 --> 01:17:43,202
He's very intelligent man.
- l'm smarter than him.

880
01:17:43,372 --> 01:17:44,703
Kill me l say!...

881
01:17:52,248 --> 01:17:54,409
You'll not leave me...not leave me.

882
01:18:42,097 --> 01:18:44,964
They left me marooned on road.
Send me a car.

883
01:18:57,980 --> 01:19:00,141
Why did Bittu kidnap her?
- l don't know.

884
01:19:10,492 --> 01:19:10,981
Did you get Bittu?

885
01:19:11,160 --> 01:19:13,492
No Sir, we've put a red alert.

886
01:19:15,631 --> 01:19:16,620
Did he see you?

887
01:19:21,170 --> 01:19:25,004
lt's not safe for you to stay here,
must shift your base.

888
01:19:26,809 --> 01:19:29,334
Where to Sir?
Guntur or Anakapalle?

889
01:19:32,014 --> 01:19:35,677
How would you feel with
a rain coat facing Tsunami?

890
01:19:36,185 --> 01:19:38,176
l feel the same now
when you say that.

891
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:39,851
l don't get it one thing
for my common sense,

892
01:19:40,022 --> 01:19:42,013
a thief runs away,
police catch him,

893
01:19:42,191 --> 01:19:43,351
why is the reverse happening here?

894
01:19:43,525 --> 01:19:45,015
Thief is catching me,

895
01:19:45,194 --> 01:19:47,025
should l be on run
for helping police?

896
01:19:47,196 --> 01:19:49,494
Police need time, right?
- How much time you need Sir?

897
01:19:49,665 --> 01:19:51,656
l got him in 15 minutes and
you let him off by morning.

898
01:19:51,834 --> 01:19:54,098
l got him in the middle of the road,
you couldn't catch him.

899
01:19:55,504 --> 01:19:57,665
Do you know the difference
between him and you,

900
01:19:57,840 --> 01:19:59,671
he doesn't care for life for money,

901
01:19:59,842 --> 01:20:02,538
but you don't even get up
from your seat for the salary.

902
01:20:05,881 --> 01:20:08,873
The madness he has,
l've much more than him.

903
01:20:09,051 --> 01:20:12,214
Let him hide inside earth,
l'll gun him down at point blank range.

904
01:20:13,389 --> 01:20:16,381
He must wet his pants on hearing
my name Ravi Narayan.

905
01:20:16,558 --> 01:20:20,392
lf l kill him police will not his
body also as evidence for postmortem.

906
01:20:22,698 --> 01:20:25,360
l'm sure about one thing,
l'll stay here only,

907
01:20:25,534 --> 01:20:29,061
put my address in newspapers,
let me what the hell he can do...

908
01:20:32,074 --> 01:20:34,065
What's your connection with Bittu?

909
01:20:34,243 --> 01:20:35,232
l don't know anything.

910
01:20:35,411 --> 01:20:38,403
He said he was the girl's relative
and then kidnapped me too.

911
01:20:38,580 --> 01:20:40,741
Why did he leave after kidnapping you?

912
01:20:42,084 --> 01:20:43,073
l'll tell you after
consulting my lawyer.

913
01:20:43,252 --> 01:20:45,243
What the hell will you consult? My foot!

914
01:20:46,088 --> 01:20:49,421
No need to discuss,
just write and get his sign.

915
01:20:49,591 --> 01:20:50,751
Do you want me to untie the knot?

916
01:20:50,926 --> 01:20:52,416
l don't know uncle,
l didn't think about it.

917
01:20:52,594 --> 01:20:54,425
Maximum is 3 minutes.
- lf not?

918
01:20:54,596 --> 01:20:57,895
After that anytime is same.
- Right, dead body will co-operate.

919
01:21:02,738 --> 01:21:06,265
Police are conducting a big
sting operation for this girl.

920
01:21:07,276 --> 01:21:09,904
lt seems her office under
camera observation.

921
01:21:10,112 --> 01:21:12,273
That's why her kidnapping
news reached immediately.

922
01:21:12,448 --> 01:21:15,281
Why isn't she getting up mother?
- May be she's dead.

923
01:21:16,285 --> 01:21:18,446
Doctors are not telling for money.

924
01:21:53,655 --> 01:21:58,149
How do you feel now?
Whatever it is you're very lucky.

925
01:21:58,327 --> 01:22:00,659
By strange coincidence Ravi
came to your office,

926
01:22:00,829 --> 01:22:04,128
and surprise l was there too
and saved you.

927
01:22:04,299 --> 01:22:06,631
lt happened coincidentally!

928
01:22:15,978 --> 01:22:17,172
How is Madhu now?

929
01:22:19,848 --> 01:22:23,181
What's your problem? Toothache?
Can l see Madhu?

930
01:22:39,001 --> 01:22:41,492
What have you done about it?
l mean the sacred thread.

931
01:22:41,670 --> 01:22:42,830
l'll talk to you later.

932
01:22:43,005 --> 01:22:44,495
How is my daughter?

933
01:22:46,208 --> 01:22:47,607
What's your problem? Toothache?

934
01:22:48,377 --> 01:22:49,605
Can l see her?

935
01:22:50,712 --> 01:22:51,542
Okay.

936
01:23:01,723 --> 01:23:05,056
Lost money!
Lala is dead!

937
01:23:05,727 --> 01:23:08,389
l think Ravi will get us too.

938
01:23:09,198 --> 01:23:13,692
One push with this will get your
brain out along with fear Koti.

939
01:23:14,870 --> 01:23:16,235
Did you see those numbers?

940
01:23:16,705 --> 01:23:18,400
One, l must to kill Ravi's family.

941
01:23:20,709 --> 01:23:23,405
Two, l must kill him.

942
01:23:25,080 --> 01:23:27,913
Three, we must escape from this country.

943
01:23:30,419 --> 01:23:33,582
lf you irritate me,
l may have to kill you too.

944
01:23:33,755 --> 01:23:38,590
My wish list would become 4,
but 3 is my lucky number.

945
01:23:38,760 --> 01:23:39,749
Yours?

946
01:24:17,099 --> 01:24:19,431
Already finished?

947
01:24:19,601 --> 01:24:21,091
Uncle Brahmam!
- Called me Sir?

948
01:24:21,303 --> 01:24:23,931
Return the stolen Beer bottle
and cashew nuts.

949
01:24:24,940 --> 01:24:26,100
How do you know it?

950
01:24:26,308 --> 01:24:28,799
His shirt is wet with
bottle's wetness.

951
01:24:28,944 --> 01:24:31,811
Cashew nut masala is on his night dress.

952
01:24:34,316 --> 01:24:35,146
Give me some.

953
01:24:36,818 --> 01:24:40,481
You're so smart,
why did you cross swords with Bittu?

954
01:24:40,656 --> 01:24:43,318
l didn't Sir, he's shouting at me.

955
01:24:43,492 --> 01:24:46,655
He has voice he'll shout,
he has a family, so he fears.

956
01:24:46,828 --> 01:24:48,489
What's your plan anyway?

957
01:24:48,664 --> 01:24:53,795
Very simple Sir, l've simply 3 targets!

958
01:24:58,974 --> 01:25:01,966
l must bring parents from Vizag
and keep them safe here.

959
01:25:05,347 --> 01:25:08,339
l must convince Madhu again
and bring her back on track.

960
01:25:13,855 --> 01:25:17,347
Let's kill Bittu Sir!
He's irritating me too much!

961
01:25:18,527 --> 01:25:20,017
When are you proposing to do this?

962
01:25:20,195 --> 01:25:23,824
Generally smart guys plan
and do it.

963
01:25:23,999 --> 01:25:27,491
Too smart guys like me
plan while doing it.

964
01:25:34,176 --> 01:25:35,370
What son?
- Have you started?

965
01:25:35,544 --> 01:25:37,535
l've booked tickets in Garib Rath.

966
01:25:37,713 --> 01:25:41,046
Tell neighbors to keep
an eye on our house.

967
01:25:41,216 --> 01:25:42,547
No need to tell them,
they'll always watch our home.

968
01:25:42,718 --> 01:25:44,549
Take a taxi to the station.

969
01:25:44,720 --> 01:25:46,381
Taxi is expensive, auto is enough.

970
01:25:46,555 --> 01:25:49,217
Father, don't show your stinginess here.
Just do as l say.

971
01:25:49,391 --> 01:25:51,052
Tickets?
- l have, get in.

972
01:25:51,226 --> 01:25:53,717
ls it a great plan to
buy ticket and board train?

973
01:25:53,895 --> 01:25:56,363
Now Bittu's group would
get down before my home.

974
01:26:00,202 --> 01:26:01,567
They'll see the door locked.

975
01:26:03,038 --> 01:26:03,868
They'll ask the neighbours.

976
01:26:04,039 --> 01:26:07,031
Though we share common wall,
we don't know a bit about them.

977
01:26:09,211 --> 01:26:11,907
People with money or gun
don't take no as answer.

978
01:26:12,080 --> 01:26:16,244
Garib Rath leaves in an hour,
one bag, two suitcases, 3 passengers.

979
01:26:16,418 --> 01:26:18,079
They went to the station in taxi.

980
01:26:18,253 --> 01:26:20,585
lt you remove the gun,
l'll walk to my home.

981
01:26:25,260 --> 01:26:26,921
Where are you now father?

982
01:26:27,095 --> 01:26:28,892
lf we take left, we'll reach
station in 10 minutes.

983
01:26:29,097 --> 01:26:31,395
Take right and hit highway
and come to Hyderabad.

984
01:26:31,566 --> 01:26:33,227
What?
To Hyderabad in car?

985
01:26:33,435 --> 01:26:36,233
Yes, in car!
- He'll ask our property.

986
01:26:36,438 --> 01:26:38,065
Seetharam will pay it, come.

987
01:26:38,240 --> 01:26:41,073
Me? Why should l pay?
- Go to Hyderabad.

988
01:26:41,610 --> 01:26:46,274
Like Pavan searches for Bhumika
in the film 'Kushi'

989
01:26:46,448 --> 01:26:50,282
Bittu's men will be searching
for my parents in station.

990
01:26:52,120 --> 01:26:53,781
This is what you call planning.

991
01:26:53,955 --> 01:26:57,288
People have a knife or gun,

992
01:26:57,459 --> 01:27:00,121
you've removed the pin and
sitting on a grenade.

993
01:27:00,295 --> 01:27:02,263
Why did you let him into your home?

994
01:27:02,431 --> 01:27:04,592
More over you're feeding him
with Beers and cashew nuts.

995
01:27:04,766 --> 01:27:07,929
What are you planning
to do with Bittu?

996
01:27:08,103 --> 01:27:11,095
Sir, you got drunk and
forgetting the order.

997
01:27:13,642 --> 01:27:15,269
My darling Madhu...

998
01:27:32,661 --> 01:27:35,152
What have l done?
Why are you so angry on me?

999
01:27:36,631 --> 01:27:38,292
Will you provoke him to kill me?

1000
01:27:38,467 --> 01:27:41,800
That was drama, just like that.
He won't kill you.

1001
01:27:41,970 --> 01:27:44,666
You used me after telling white lies.

1002
01:27:44,806 --> 01:27:48,139
Don't use that word,
people may mistake you.

1003
01:27:48,310 --> 01:27:50,141
l'll beat you with my slipper.

1004
01:27:50,312 --> 01:27:53,008
lsn't there any control to your tongue?
Will you say whatever you feel?

1005
01:27:53,181 --> 01:27:55,843
You mean....pleas you tell me Sir.

1006
01:27:56,017 --> 01:27:58,349
l made Miss Worst
to Miss World girl,

1007
01:27:58,520 --> 01:28:00,852
look, every man is ogling at her.

1008
01:28:02,190 --> 01:28:04,522
Do you know how many dreams
l had for you?- What dreams?

1009
01:28:04,693 --> 01:28:06,183
Like we're married...

1010
01:28:06,361 --> 01:28:09,489
Like having two sons Bobby and Bablu.

1011
01:28:09,664 --> 01:28:11,996
Make one as daughter,
it'll add colour to life.

1012
01:28:12,167 --> 01:28:16,001
Two moustaches and beards won't be fine.
- Get lots!

1013
01:28:16,705 --> 01:28:18,536
l started wearing jeans for him.

1014
01:28:18,707 --> 01:28:22,871
To avoid disturbance in future to kiss
l removed glasses and wearing lens.

1015
01:28:23,044 --> 01:28:25,035
Didn't l do anything then?
- ls it my mistake?

1016
01:28:25,180 --> 01:28:26,875
You're saying as
if l did the mistake.

1017
01:28:28,717 --> 01:28:31,049
Not you or me, he'll tell us,
please tell me Sir.

1018
01:28:43,365 --> 01:28:45,026
l kept aside to eat
without disturbance.

1019
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:48,863
You both are fighting over something.

1020
01:28:49,037 --> 01:28:50,265
Can you please start again?

1021
01:28:55,210 --> 01:28:56,734
Bloody deaf!

1022
01:28:59,080 --> 01:29:02,743
Madhu, no need auto, l'll drop you.
l'll drop you on my bike.

1023
01:29:02,918 --> 01:29:08,413
Yes but l want same bike, same colour,
and the same man must bring it.

1024
01:29:08,590 --> 01:29:11,423
Shall l close my eyes?
- What are you saying?

1025
01:29:15,597 --> 01:29:16,564
Do you want the bike again Sir?

1026
01:29:16,731 --> 01:29:18,392
Go...go..
- Want me to go that side?

1027
01:29:18,567 --> 01:29:21,593
l'm going on urgent work,
if you want, take it.

1028
01:29:21,770 --> 01:29:24,238
Why did you give your bike that day?

1029
01:29:24,406 --> 01:29:30,606
A police officer in the next
street threatened to break it.

1030
01:29:30,779 --> 01:29:32,440
Why did you smile then?

1031
01:29:32,614 --> 01:29:34,605
Like this? He told me to smile and give.

1032
01:29:36,284 --> 01:29:37,774
This wasn't my mistake.

1033
01:29:37,953 --> 01:29:40,012
Trust me, Seetharam made me
do it under threat.

1034
01:29:44,125 --> 01:29:45,285
Please listen to me.

1035
01:29:46,795 --> 01:29:51,255
Had it not rained then, l wouldn't
have talked to you or had tea.

1036
01:29:51,433 --> 01:29:53,094
Water tank is here only!

1037
01:29:54,436 --> 01:29:57,269
Why are you looking embarrassed?
Was rain also a plan?

1038
01:29:59,808 --> 01:30:01,639
How can l plan rain?
- Tell me the truth.

1039
01:30:05,146 --> 01:30:08,479
Oh God! How did it rain when l wished?

1040
01:30:46,354 --> 01:30:48,845
Don't get angry,
my honey eyed beauty...

1041
01:30:55,363 --> 01:30:58,161
Don't frown, Oh jasmine...

1042
01:31:00,168 --> 01:31:04,867
Like police car siren...
Like an ambulance horn...

1043
01:31:05,006 --> 01:31:09,705
Why are you making so much noise
like you've swallowed a loud speaker?

1044
01:31:09,878 --> 01:31:14,212
Don't add chilly to the love wound
and tie a thread to my heart...

1045
01:31:15,383 --> 01:31:19,046
Don't let it fly as you wish
here and there...

1046
01:31:19,220 --> 01:31:22,121
Hey don't leave me hanging...

1047
01:31:23,892 --> 01:31:26,725
Hey don't trash me and run away...

1048
01:31:28,229 --> 01:31:32,859
Hey don't leave him hanging...

1049
01:31:33,034 --> 01:31:38,199
Hey don't trash him and run away...

1050
01:31:56,257 --> 01:31:58,748
Without you accompanying me
when l went to temple...

1051
01:31:58,927 --> 01:32:00,918
God himself sent me back...

1052
01:32:01,096 --> 01:32:05,897
Pub has no entry board
if l go there without you...

1053
01:32:08,069 --> 01:32:12,563
Mirror too scolds me
if sees me single...

1054
01:32:12,774 --> 01:32:17,768
My shadow is confused unable
to recognize me...

1055
01:32:17,946 --> 01:32:22,440
Like salt less food,
like dance less Chiranjeevi film...

1056
01:32:22,617 --> 01:32:27,111
Without you l don't have any life...

1057
01:32:27,288 --> 01:32:30,280
Hey don't wash and dry me...

1058
01:32:31,626 --> 01:32:35,460
Hey don't squeeze me out...

1059
01:32:36,598 --> 01:32:39,931
Hey don't wash and dry him...

1060
01:32:41,269 --> 01:32:46,138
Hey don't squeeze him out..

1061
01:33:11,633 --> 01:33:16,127
lf you play cricket,
l'll buy each ticket paying a lakh...

1062
01:33:16,304 --> 01:33:21,298
lf umpire gives you out,
l'll seek vengeance on him...

1063
01:33:23,478 --> 01:33:27,847
l'm the crore people waiting
in queue for your smile...

1064
01:33:28,016 --> 01:33:33,010
Though you make me cry,
l'm the lone joker to make you laugh...

1065
01:33:33,188 --> 01:33:35,520
Liquor is there for heart fails...

1066
01:33:35,690 --> 01:33:37,851
People are there as love failures...

1067
01:33:38,026 --> 01:33:42,190
l was fresh like fruit but
you've made a patient...

1068
01:33:42,363 --> 01:33:45,332
Hey don't tear me into pieces...

1069
01:33:47,001 --> 01:33:50,664
Hey don't kill and bury me...

1070
01:33:51,673 --> 01:33:55,268
Hey don't tear him into pieces...

1071
01:33:56,678 --> 01:34:01,547
Hey don't kill and bury him...

1072
01:34:20,368 --> 01:34:22,359
Dear...
- Father!

1073
01:34:23,705 --> 01:34:26,697
Calm down dear!
ls he teasing you?

1074
01:34:26,908 --> 01:34:29,706
You feel tortured dear?
- Yes father.

1075
01:34:29,911 --> 01:34:34,905
Did anyone smile at you
when you had clip for teeth? No!

1076
01:34:35,083 --> 01:34:39,076
Did anyone see when you wore glasses?
No!

1077
01:34:39,254 --> 01:34:44,419
Did anyone recognize you as girl
when you wore churidhar? No!

1078
01:34:44,592 --> 01:34:46,753
Look now, how many fans you have!

1079
01:34:47,762 --> 01:34:49,593
Why are you talking to him?
Who are you man?

1080
01:34:49,731 --> 01:34:52,564
What's this nuisance before my home?
You don't know about me,

1081
01:34:52,734 --> 01:34:55,396
if l beat, for the effect
you better ask him.

1082
01:34:55,570 --> 01:34:57,401
Body aches will be for many days.

1083
01:34:59,574 --> 01:35:02,941
Will you please give me
some coconut oil aunt?

1084
01:35:04,112 --> 01:35:07,104
l saw people drinking water if thirsty,
l'm seeing only you having oil.

1085
01:35:07,282 --> 01:35:08,613
May be from Kerala.

1086
01:35:24,265 --> 01:35:25,323
lt is shining!

1087
01:35:26,434 --> 01:35:27,423
lt fires too!

1088
01:35:29,437 --> 01:35:32,770
Hey pig! At least stop
crying while eating!

1089
01:35:32,974 --> 01:35:37,308
Give some to your sister too,
she looks like a famine country's model.

1090
01:35:37,478 --> 01:35:38,376
Yes!

1091
01:35:39,147 --> 01:35:40,307
Aunt!

1092
01:35:40,481 --> 01:35:44,815
lf you act smart using this
as ruse, l will...

1093
01:35:45,320 --> 01:35:47,720
What were you saying till now...

1094
01:35:50,992 --> 01:35:51,822
Shut up!

1095
01:35:52,160 --> 01:35:54,993
How would you look after Madhu from now?
- Like an angel!

1096
01:35:55,163 --> 01:35:58,132
Will you show the offering
and eat it yourself?

1097
01:35:58,633 --> 01:35:59,793
Look after her like human.

1098
01:36:00,001 --> 01:36:02,993
lf there's any difference
in the treatment.

1099
01:36:03,171 --> 01:36:05,298
l'll gun you down!

1100
01:36:09,177 --> 01:36:10,804
Think about me, please.

1101
01:36:14,015 --> 01:36:15,676
lt went off by mistake,
please don't forget about me.

1102
01:36:21,356 --> 01:36:24,018
To catch Bittu,
Travel Murthy must come out.

1103
01:36:24,192 --> 01:36:26,854
lf Travel Murthy is to come out,
Uncle must in.

1104
01:36:31,499 --> 01:36:33,023
Do you know whom you dared to arrest?

1105
01:36:33,167 --> 01:36:35,658
l'm drunk like you in day time,
l've arrested knowing well.

1106
01:36:35,837 --> 01:36:37,031
Shut your gob and sleep.

1107
01:36:38,506 --> 01:36:39,370
Why did they arrest you?

1108
01:36:39,507 --> 01:36:42,032
l'm accused of making fake passports.
- What's wrong in it?

1109
01:36:43,211 --> 01:36:45,202
That's an art!
Are they arresting artistes too?

1110
01:36:45,380 --> 01:36:46,369
What's your case?

1111
01:36:46,547 --> 01:36:49,038
They arrested me for making
come true a mother's wish.

1112
01:36:49,217 --> 01:36:50,377
Mother's wish?

1113
01:36:51,719 --> 01:36:57,214
Yes, a mother told her son if you're
mischief a devil will catch you.

1114
01:36:58,059 --> 01:36:59,219
He didn't believe it.

1115
01:37:00,395 --> 01:37:01,726
He came out.

1116
01:37:02,563 --> 01:37:06,693
lf what his mother said doesn't
come true, he'll never come in life.

1117
01:37:07,201 --> 01:37:11,365
So l took the risk and kidnapped him.

1118
01:37:13,875 --> 01:37:17,709
Strange the boy's mother
slapped a case on me.

1119
01:37:18,246 --> 01:37:19,907
For kidnapping her son.

1120
01:37:34,595 --> 01:37:37,063
Are you planning to make
a hole to wall and escape?

1121
01:37:37,231 --> 01:37:38,892
We'll shift you to sub jail tomorrow,

1122
01:37:39,067 --> 01:37:41,797
the plates as well as the plates
are thicker and stronger. Try there!

1123
01:37:45,573 --> 01:37:46,437
What?

1124
01:37:46,574 --> 01:37:49,441
l want a bag full of papers
and a dozen pens.- Why?

1125
01:37:49,610 --> 01:37:51,601
To write my autobiography.
- You?

1126
01:37:51,746 --> 01:37:55,614
Can Gandhi and Nehru only
write autobiographies in jail?

1127
01:37:55,783 --> 01:37:58,445
Do they only have souls?
Don't l have it?

1128
01:37:58,619 --> 01:38:00,780
l too have a soul and it has a story.

1129
01:38:00,955 --> 01:38:03,446
l don't have paper and pens,
get it for me.

1130
01:38:03,624 --> 01:38:08,288
Give few papers and pens from Writer.
lt seems he'll write autobiography.

1131
01:38:22,643 --> 01:38:24,474
What?
- l want a cup of tea Sir.

1132
01:38:24,645 --> 01:38:25,976
l'll beat you with slippers.

1133
01:38:26,147 --> 01:38:28,479
Writer's block Sir.
Can't write now.

1134
01:38:28,649 --> 01:38:31,880
He'll irritate us like this,
let's go out.- Okay Sir.

1135
01:38:33,821 --> 01:38:36,312
Not just you, we'll also
come out following you.

1136
01:38:44,465 --> 01:38:47,457
lf it is open both of them can escape!

1137
01:38:47,635 --> 01:38:49,796
Don't be excited, let's walk casually.

1138
01:38:55,810 --> 01:38:57,334
What's that?
- Phones.

1139
01:38:57,512 --> 01:38:58,809
Who is he?
- Fans!

1140
01:38:59,013 --> 01:39:01,174
Can't he give it straight?
Why did he a take a round?

1141
01:39:01,349 --> 01:39:03,340
Fans have emotions only, no logic.

1142
01:39:03,518 --> 01:39:06,510
Call me by evening, my number is in it.

1143
01:39:15,530 --> 01:39:17,157
He'll call from the phone
you gave him, right?

1144
01:39:17,331 --> 01:39:19,492
Surely Sir. He trusts me.

1145
01:39:20,501 --> 01:39:23,664
lf he doesn't use it,
it's difficult to catch Bittu.

1146
01:39:31,212 --> 01:39:32,702
Ravi is alive!

1147
01:39:35,716 --> 01:39:38,207
l'll not go from here
till l kill him.

1148
01:39:42,390 --> 01:39:46,554
He must get dejected in life
and commit suicide.

1149
01:39:47,395 --> 01:39:49,056
You can't even touch him.

1150
01:39:50,198 --> 01:39:55,534
You asked for men, van, crane
and took lakhs of money from me.

1151
01:39:55,703 --> 01:40:00,572
l created a family for you and
spent lakhs to get you passports.

1152
01:40:00,708 --> 01:40:07,079
When Sattar died, l paid compensation
to his family and got the papers.

1153
01:40:08,082 --> 01:40:10,243
You couldn't go to airport
and catch a flight.

1154
01:40:10,418 --> 01:40:13,251
l've spent more than
Rs.1.5 crores on you.

1155
01:40:13,421 --> 01:40:16,982
This coffee is extra expense to me
and bonus to you, have it.

1156
01:40:17,925 --> 01:40:19,756
Why is he angry?

1157
01:40:21,095 --> 01:40:25,725
You haven't anything till now
other than this sign language.

1158
01:40:25,900 --> 01:40:30,428
Had l trusted Ravi he would've
looted the bank in 15 minutes.

1159
01:40:30,571 --> 01:40:34,268
A 25 year old young man is
giving you a run for your money.

1160
01:40:34,442 --> 01:40:37,070
Go and lick is underarms.

1161
01:40:37,612 --> 01:40:39,273
Sitting here shamelessly!

1162
01:40:49,290 --> 01:40:52,953
lf a man ogles a woman
when her husband is nearby,

1163
01:40:53,127 --> 01:40:54,958
do you know how bad she'd feel?

1164
01:40:55,463 --> 01:40:59,331
When you praised him before me,
l had the same feelings.

1165
01:41:00,101 --> 01:41:03,298
Sign language?
Do you know what did l tell her?

1166
01:41:03,471 --> 01:41:05,098
l told her l'll stab you.

1167
01:41:05,773 --> 01:41:10,472
Never pass comments on impaired.
Wrong, it's wrong.

1168
01:41:12,480 --> 01:41:18,646
lf l say sorry now,
she may not hear it. Save my life.

1169
01:41:18,819 --> 01:41:20,980
My heart is broken.

1170
01:41:22,823 --> 01:41:25,155
l don't care whether you live or die.

1171
01:41:25,326 --> 01:41:26,657
Money!

1172
01:41:29,330 --> 01:41:31,127
Rs.1,500 crores!

1173
01:41:33,134 --> 01:41:36,501
l'll give it to you, save my life.

1174
01:41:36,637 --> 01:41:39,333
Money...do you've money?
- Yes.

1175
01:41:39,807 --> 01:41:42,332
Money is there!

1176
01:41:42,510 --> 01:41:44,842
But we saw money burnt to ashes.

1177
01:41:44,979 --> 01:41:47,174
But l saw it getting burnt.

1178
01:41:48,349 --> 01:41:53,412
Only the trailer burned,
l had shifted the money earlier.

1179
01:41:59,026 --> 01:42:00,357
Where have you hidden the money?

1180
01:42:01,529 --> 01:42:02,689
Where?

1181
01:42:04,498 --> 01:42:05,726
Where?

1182
01:42:14,375 --> 01:42:15,774
He's dead Bittu.

1183
01:42:19,013 --> 01:42:20,776
Can l make a call?
- Do it.

1184
01:42:35,563 --> 01:42:39,522
l suspected he'll not use the phone,
so l planted a transmitter on him.

1185
01:42:50,044 --> 01:42:50,408
l'm Murthy here Sir.

1186
01:42:50,578 --> 01:42:52,409
Getting bail is difficult, so l escaped.

1187
01:42:52,580 --> 01:42:53,569
lt's all commotion here.

1188
01:42:53,748 --> 01:42:55,079
lt's very difficult to
send Bittu out of country.

1189
01:42:55,249 --> 01:42:59,242
First know with whom
you're talking to Murthy.

1190
01:43:02,423 --> 01:43:03,822
Where's Varadarajulu?

1191
01:43:05,259 --> 01:43:06,920
He's out of coverage area.

1192
01:43:07,261 --> 01:43:10,094
l came out with great
difficulty to talk to him.

1193
01:43:10,898 --> 01:43:14,425
You're not that smart.
- No Sir. l managed to escape.

1194
01:43:14,568 --> 01:43:20,234
The man who made you escape,
the man who is making you talk...

1195
01:43:21,442 --> 01:43:22,602
l'm telling him,

1196
01:43:32,453 --> 01:43:34,614
l want to tell you a small story Ravi.

1197
01:43:35,289 --> 01:43:39,623
Everyday my father used to come drunk
and beat me and my brother.

1198
01:43:40,461 --> 01:43:44,921
l managed but Lala was very young.
He used to cry a lot!

1199
01:43:45,099 --> 01:43:51,766
One night a thief smashed my father's
head and took his purse.

1200
01:43:51,939 --> 01:43:55,102
He was hit strongly and
my father died.

1201
01:43:55,643 --> 01:43:57,634
After that my brother never cried in life.

1202
01:43:57,812 --> 01:44:01,213
One thing nobody knows,
even my brother too.

1203
01:44:02,817 --> 01:44:04,148
l was that thief.

1204
01:44:10,491 --> 01:44:12,982
l killed my father for beating him.

1205
01:44:14,662 --> 01:44:18,120
You killed him,
what would l do with you?

1206
01:44:21,302 --> 01:44:23,668
l'm leaving it to your imagination.

1207
01:44:28,142 --> 01:44:29,507
Let's have a tea break.

1208
01:44:30,311 --> 01:44:31,505
Do you've sense or not?

1209
01:44:31,679 --> 01:44:34,512
He's warning you,
don't you've any fear?

1210
01:44:34,682 --> 01:44:36,673
There's trap in fear,
we mustn't fear anyone.

1211
01:44:36,851 --> 01:44:39,843
Let's take on him.
- No...

1212
01:44:40,020 --> 01:44:45,014
lf hope can cure a cancer patient,
fear would kill an ulcer patient.

1213
01:44:50,331 --> 01:44:52,822
He threatened to kill you,
aren't you scared?

1214
01:44:53,000 --> 01:44:55,525
Death has no feelings, just sharpness.

1215
01:44:55,703 --> 01:44:59,161
l'll also kill him,
he boasted and l didn't.

1216
01:44:59,340 --> 01:45:00,329
That's the difference.

1217
01:45:02,343 --> 01:45:04,038
Uncle! Did you see Madhu?

1218
01:45:07,047 --> 01:45:10,039
Everything is blur with your shot,
l don't see anything.

1219
01:45:11,886 --> 01:45:15,720
Uncle, l'll not bear her anymore,
l'll use force!

1220
01:45:20,394 --> 01:45:21,053
Come.

1221
01:45:25,699 --> 01:45:28,190
Stop! You don't know about me,
don't neglect me.

1222
01:45:28,369 --> 01:45:31,361
Yes, l don't know about you,
l don't know if your love is true,

1223
01:45:31,572 --> 01:45:33,039
l don't know if your name
is true or not.

1224
01:45:36,577 --> 01:45:37,737
You want my details, right?

1225
01:45:37,912 --> 01:45:39,573
My name is Ravi,
my father is Narayanamurthy,

1226
01:45:39,747 --> 01:45:42,739
my mother is Kameshwari,
my sister is Raji...

1227
01:45:46,921 --> 01:45:50,084
Nobody is giving direction
to Seetharam's house.

1228
01:45:50,257 --> 01:45:51,588
We're searching for 3 hours now.

1229
01:45:51,759 --> 01:45:55,092
Father, l mean...
My father!

1230
01:45:58,566 --> 01:46:00,056
What timing is yours!

1231
01:46:00,234 --> 01:46:01,724
Did you keep them in next street?

1232
01:46:01,902 --> 01:46:04,063
They made an entry as soon as
l said about them.

1233
01:46:04,238 --> 01:46:05,398
They're my real parents.

1234
01:46:05,606 --> 01:46:08,404
Hello, he's shameless!
Shouldn't you've it?

1235
01:46:08,609 --> 01:46:09,598
Who is she?

1236
01:46:09,777 --> 01:46:11,608
Do you've to accept to
be his father if he asks?

1237
01:46:11,779 --> 01:46:13,269
Do you've any resemblance with him?

1238
01:46:13,447 --> 01:46:15,938
He's after me.
- Mother, don't talk mad.

1239
01:46:16,116 --> 01:46:20,109
Your mother is very homely.
- Why is she talking too much?

1240
01:46:20,287 --> 01:46:22,278
Your character has no dialogues,
keep quiet.

1241
01:46:22,456 --> 01:46:24,287
l'm warning you, l'll beat her.

1242
01:46:24,458 --> 01:46:26,619
l'll talk to her...
- Why are you begging her?

1243
01:46:26,794 --> 01:46:27,954
You took money, right?

1244
01:46:28,128 --> 01:46:29,959
Money...- Money?...- Money?
- Haven't you?

1245
01:46:30,097 --> 01:46:31,928
Have you gone mad Madhu?

1246
01:46:32,099 --> 01:46:36,934
l know my son is cheat but l think
he's not so cheap to change parents.

1247
01:46:37,104 --> 01:46:40,096
One more thing, l've complete
faith in my wife.

1248
01:46:40,274 --> 01:46:42,640
Don't try to spoil it
after 25 years of marriage.

1249
01:46:42,810 --> 01:46:45,802
lt may be a bad word to you
but he's my son. She's my daughter.

1250
01:46:45,980 --> 01:46:48,312
lf you marry him,
she's your half husband.

1251
01:46:48,482 --> 01:46:52,145
She'll rip out your skin,
she's not as good as she looks.

1252
01:46:52,653 --> 01:46:53,984
Take right and go straight father.

1253
01:46:54,154 --> 01:46:56,315
We'll go straight, you be straight.

1254
01:46:58,492 --> 01:47:00,323
Oh my God!

1255
01:47:00,494 --> 01:47:03,327
Should l love you really?
- l'll beat you.

1256
01:47:03,464 --> 01:47:06,661
lf you lie always and tell the truth
once, this will be the result.

1257
01:47:10,471 --> 01:47:12,462
Stop!...

1258
01:47:16,677 --> 01:47:17,302
Hold this.

1259
01:47:19,513 --> 01:47:23,347
What for?
- You're not staying put

1260
01:47:23,517 --> 01:47:24,677
Please listen to me.

1261
01:47:24,852 --> 01:47:29,016
l love you so much.
l'm mad about you.

1262
01:47:29,189 --> 01:47:30,850
Please listen to me.
Marry me.

1263
01:47:31,025 --> 01:47:32,356
l'll look after you like a princess.

1264
01:47:32,526 --> 01:47:33,686
One more thing.

1265
01:47:33,861 --> 01:47:36,853
This is little risky matter,
keeping it for safety.

1266
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:42,867
lt has come this far,
so l'm telling you shamelessly.

1267
01:47:43,003 --> 01:47:44,994
l'm waiting eagerly for our first night.

1268
01:47:45,172 --> 01:47:48,505
We must work hard and
have children like this. Okay?

1269
01:47:48,709 --> 01:47:50,040
Don't cry, please smile.

1270
01:47:50,210 --> 01:47:52,041
l'm scared...l'm going.

1271
01:48:00,888 --> 01:48:04,221
You home has gate,
l've doubt to jump over it...

1272
01:48:04,391 --> 01:48:08,885
Streetlights don't burn in your lane,
l'm new to the area...

1273
01:48:11,699 --> 01:48:15,032
There's a dog before the gate,
which barks me to stop...

1274
01:48:15,202 --> 01:48:19,434
lt has big teeth and
makes me scary...

1275
01:48:20,741 --> 01:48:23,904
There's a beggar before your home,
he's wearing a holed shorts...

1276
01:48:24,078 --> 01:48:27,741
l look like ajoker to his eyes...

1277
01:48:27,915 --> 01:48:31,578
lf you wake up and
jump from balcony...

1278
01:48:31,752 --> 01:48:35,085
Let's rock in love...

1279
01:48:35,255 --> 01:48:38,918
Let's celebrate our marriage...

1280
01:49:10,958 --> 01:49:16,794
There's a coffee house in Koti,
it's famous for cappuccino...

1281
01:49:17,931 --> 01:49:21,423
lf your hot lips touch
the hot coffee cups...

1282
01:49:21,602 --> 01:49:24,969
Hands under the table play
the game of love...

1283
01:49:25,105 --> 01:49:30,975
ls yours coffee drinking face?
l know your bloody idea...

1284
01:49:32,312 --> 01:49:35,804
Wearing sleeveless dresses and
miniskirts showing knees...

1285
01:49:35,983 --> 01:49:39,316
Your hungry looks are
a big nuisance...

1286
01:49:39,486 --> 01:49:42,978
No Chitti, l got a naughty thought...

1287
01:49:43,157 --> 01:49:46,490
l want to hold you before everyone
and give a French kiss...

1288
01:49:46,660 --> 01:49:50,494
To rock my force and my style...

1289
01:50:33,173 --> 01:50:39,203
There's a theatre in old city
that plays old love films...

1290
01:50:40,380 --> 01:50:43,713
Watch a reel munching popcorn and
pass the interval with a vegetable cutlet...

1291
01:50:43,884 --> 01:50:47,376
Let's learn the alphabets of love
watching duets every 15 minutes...

1292
01:50:47,554 --> 01:50:54,551
Stop narrating tales,
don't try to fool me...

1293
01:50:54,728 --> 01:50:58,186
Corner seat in empty theatre
and one coke with two straws...

1294
01:50:58,365 --> 01:51:01,698
You'll get mischievous
exploring all over me...

1295
01:51:01,902 --> 01:51:05,201
Hey not like that,
how am l to manage her?

1296
01:51:05,372 --> 01:51:08,899
Do Jesus and Allah have to come
back again to convince you?

1297
01:51:09,076 --> 01:51:13,240
lf you come to watch
my matinee show...

1298
01:51:43,277 --> 01:51:45,939
She's thin like a stick,
how could you like her?

1299
01:51:46,113 --> 01:51:48,445
Zero size, that's the latest fad.

1300
01:51:49,283 --> 01:51:52,116
She scolded me.
- She slapped me.

1301
01:51:53,120 --> 01:51:55,782
He would've done something
to make her so angry.

1302
01:52:00,794 --> 01:52:01,453
What?

1303
01:52:13,607 --> 01:52:16,599
What would they think
if you enter my bedroom?

1304
01:52:18,145 --> 01:52:22,479
My father and step mother are
coming to fix marriage.- Now?

1305
01:52:22,983 --> 01:52:26,714
She doesn't know you're
the bridegroom.

1306
01:52:28,655 --> 01:52:31,146
You must manage my step mom.
- Are you mad?

1307
01:52:31,325 --> 01:52:34,488
Manage your step mom?
Do you know what you're saying?

1308
01:52:34,661 --> 01:52:37,152
l'm unable to manage for
what you had done already, go.

1309
01:52:37,331 --> 01:52:38,958
This is not the right time.
Go...go away!

1310
01:52:41,468 --> 01:52:42,127
Shall l go away?

1311
01:52:42,302 --> 01:52:44,634
l didn't mean you to go literally.

1312
01:52:44,805 --> 01:52:46,796
lt was big trouble yesterday.

1313
01:52:47,007 --> 01:52:50,499
Moreover you don't know about my father.

1314
01:52:50,644 --> 01:52:54,512
lf he comes to know this,
do you know how angry he would be?

1315
01:52:56,516 --> 01:52:57,847
My father is...

1316
01:52:59,853 --> 01:53:01,844
Tell me...

1317
01:53:07,361 --> 01:53:08,521
Tell me!

1318
01:53:11,164 --> 01:53:13,155
Wear clothes, my throat has gone dry.

1319
01:53:37,557 --> 01:53:38,717
Why did you come here?

1320
01:53:38,892 --> 01:53:40,553
As if you're great Aishwarya Rai!

1321
01:53:40,727 --> 01:53:42,718
l came here following your daughter.

1322
01:53:42,896 --> 01:53:46,525
Are you planning her marriage
in my absence? l'll kill you.

1323
01:53:46,700 --> 01:53:48,361
Do you know this is a
great police officer's house?

1324
01:53:48,535 --> 01:53:50,765
Then, who is the groom?

1325
01:53:53,073 --> 01:53:53,869
ls it him?

1326
01:53:59,246 --> 01:54:00,406
He?

1327
01:54:01,248 --> 01:54:02,408
l like him.

1328
01:54:12,926 --> 01:54:16,828
Ravi, chemistry is working out
between me and her.

1329
01:54:19,232 --> 01:54:21,723
What's this nastily?
She's my mother-in-law.

1330
01:54:21,902 --> 01:54:24,393
She's her step mother, right?
- So what?

1331
01:54:26,273 --> 01:54:30,607
Okay, since you're feeling so much,
we'll elope after your marriage.

1332
01:54:31,611 --> 01:54:33,442
l want to talk to the groom.

1333
01:54:42,956 --> 01:54:44,617
l like you so much.

1334
01:54:49,463 --> 01:54:53,422
When you talk to me,
my palms are sweating.

1335
01:54:54,267 --> 01:54:56,497
Tell me.
- What did you like in us?

1336
01:54:56,770 --> 01:54:59,762
You've made me raise my head high!

1337
01:55:02,776 --> 01:55:04,141
What do you do?

1338
01:55:04,945 --> 01:55:06,207
Stealing!

1339
01:55:06,646 --> 01:55:08,477
You've already stolen a heart!

1340
01:55:17,991 --> 01:55:22,325
Don't know why l felt like
looking into your eyes.

1341
01:55:25,298 --> 01:55:26,959
Whether this society accepts it or not,

1342
01:55:27,167 --> 01:55:28,964
l don't care if you think
l'm overdoing it,

1343
01:55:29,169 --> 01:55:31,330
l'll marry her.
- You...

1344
01:55:31,805 --> 01:55:33,170
Leave my hand.
- Have you gone mad?

1345
01:55:33,340 --> 01:55:35,968
You came here to fix your daughter's
marriage and having affair with servant.

1346
01:55:36,176 --> 01:55:37,973
Servant? He's the groom, right?

1347
01:55:38,178 --> 01:55:40,840
l'm like his son,
how can he be the groom?

1348
01:55:41,348 --> 01:55:42,508
He's the groom!

1349
01:55:44,184 --> 01:55:45,674
l'll not accept.
- Why?

1350
01:55:45,852 --> 01:55:49,185
l was married to an old man,
so she should also marry an old man.

1351
01:55:51,024 --> 01:55:52,514
What have you done?

1352
01:55:52,692 --> 01:55:55,684
Slapping the cheeks which should
be smooched with kisses.

1353
01:55:57,364 --> 01:55:58,991
He steals everything
and she slapped him.

1354
01:55:59,166 --> 01:56:01,498
That's not enough for him.
He deserves more.

1355
01:56:07,374 --> 01:56:09,205
Don't park the car,
l'll come back immediately.

1356
01:56:11,845 --> 01:56:12,834
Haven't you yet gone to Vizag?

1357
01:56:13,013 --> 01:56:15,379
l came to say good bye.
Just for fun.

1358
01:56:15,549 --> 01:56:16,538
No, l've to go.

1359
01:56:16,716 --> 01:56:19,207
No way, come and sit.
- No, getting late to flight.

1360
01:56:19,386 --> 01:56:21,217
You too look busy.

1361
01:56:21,721 --> 01:56:23,211
lt's about Ravi's engagement.

1362
01:56:26,893 --> 01:56:28,053
l'll take leave.

1363
01:56:30,063 --> 01:56:31,860
Sir, l'll send him off.

1364
01:56:33,366 --> 01:56:34,526
How far the case has come?

1365
01:56:34,701 --> 01:56:39,035
We're serious about the case,
talked to Varadarajulu too.

1366
01:56:39,239 --> 01:56:42,697
Don't underestimate Bittu,
it's good to be brave.

1367
01:56:42,876 --> 01:56:44,867
But it's wrong to be careful, right?

1368
01:56:46,580 --> 01:56:48,411
Where?
- l forgot my phone.

1369
01:56:48,582 --> 01:56:51,915
One minute, l know where the phone is.
l'll get it.

1370
01:56:53,086 --> 01:56:54,576
Uncle, give the phone.

1371
01:57:24,451 --> 01:57:26,783
Which one is Ravi's family?

1372
01:57:28,121 --> 01:57:29,782
Leave me!

1373
01:57:31,791 --> 01:57:32,780
Come.

1374
01:57:34,461 --> 01:57:35,120
Come.

1375
01:57:35,295 --> 01:57:36,785
Take them quickly!

1376
01:57:36,963 --> 01:57:40,922
lf you tell anyone l'll kill you.
- Father!

1377
01:57:42,435 --> 01:57:43,094
Come.

1378
01:59:01,214 --> 01:59:06,880
Brother...brother...brother...
- Get in...

1379
01:59:16,563 --> 01:59:18,360
Brother...brother...

1380
01:59:19,532 --> 01:59:20,362
Brother!

1381
01:59:23,203 --> 01:59:24,192
Brother!

1382
02:00:23,296 --> 02:00:25,594
Father...father!

1383
02:00:25,932 --> 02:00:26,921
Father!

1384
02:00:33,106 --> 02:00:34,801
l'll kill you, you bastard!

1385
02:00:37,477 --> 02:00:41,811
Hubby!
- Father!

1386
02:00:42,148 --> 02:00:43,809
How dare you fire at my father?
- Leave me...

1387
02:00:43,983 --> 02:00:47,817
Brother!
- Leave him son!

1388
02:00:47,987 --> 02:00:49,215
Father!

1389
02:00:49,489 --> 02:00:51,650
Leave me, your father is alive!

1390
02:00:51,825 --> 02:00:53,315
Call ambulance!

1391
02:01:05,805 --> 02:01:06,134
Sir, my father.

1392
02:01:06,306 --> 02:01:08,501
Don't worry, nothing will happen to him.

1393
02:01:08,675 --> 02:01:11,303
You come with me.
- Come to the station.

1394
02:01:11,511 --> 02:01:13,308
l'm talking to him, right?

1395
02:01:14,681 --> 02:01:19,015
This phone has the trigger
that set off to kill ACP.

1396
02:01:25,692 --> 02:01:28,525
They'll interrogate for formality,
go with them.

1397
02:01:28,695 --> 02:01:31,493
How can l leave my father?
- l'll take care of him. You go.

1398
02:01:49,716 --> 02:01:50,944
Where is Ravi?

1399
02:01:53,386 --> 02:01:55,547
Come, let's go to the hospital.

1400
02:01:55,722 --> 02:01:58,213
What happened Sir?
- Nothing to worry.

1401
02:01:58,391 --> 02:01:59,551
What happened to my father?

1402
02:01:59,726 --> 02:02:00,886
l said nothing to worry.

1403
02:02:01,060 --> 02:02:02,391
l can take it Sir, tell me.

1404
02:02:04,063 --> 02:02:05,360
Come with me, l'll tell you.

1405
02:02:05,532 --> 02:02:08,865
Taking as if he's in a hotel?
He's an accused.

1406
02:02:09,035 --> 02:02:10,935
l'll bring him back in an hour.
- Rules don't accept.

1407
02:02:12,205 --> 02:02:14,036
This is my station.
l'll take care of it.

1408
02:02:14,374 --> 02:02:16,205
Tell us what we should write then.

1409
02:02:20,079 --> 02:02:25,244
Write l'm taking my son on
my personal guaranty. ls it enough?

1410
02:02:26,753 --> 02:02:27,412
Come.

1411
02:02:55,114 --> 02:02:57,014
Your father wants to see you.

1412
02:02:58,117 --> 02:03:00,108
BP is highly fluctuating.

1413
02:03:01,287 --> 02:03:04,688
Don't tell him about your arrest
or Raji's kidnap.

1414
02:03:21,441 --> 02:03:27,971
Had you not taken Rs.10,000 that day,
we'd be watching a film on TV at home!

1415
02:03:29,315 --> 02:03:31,715
Your mother would've made pakodis,

1416
02:03:33,820 --> 02:03:35,651
your sister would be up to some mischief.

1417
02:03:37,824 --> 02:03:39,314
That's wealth!

1418
02:03:40,493 --> 02:03:43,985
lt is 10 million times valuable
than your one lakh rupees.

1419
02:03:46,799 --> 02:03:53,671
You know the logic that train speeding
at 60 kms won't stop at platform,

1420
02:03:53,840 --> 02:03:58,174
don't know that no bank would give
Rs.1 lakh interest in 2 hours.

1421
02:03:58,478 --> 02:04:05,509
lf that really happens,
l should be in hospital at 80,

1422
02:04:05,685 --> 02:04:08,017
but your father would is
in hospital at 50.

1423
02:04:09,522 --> 02:04:12,514
lf that comes at speed,
this too comes at speed.

1424
02:04:14,527 --> 02:04:18,019
When l think l don't see much
difference between you and Bittu.

1425
02:04:19,832 --> 02:04:23,495
You want lakhs and he wants crores.

1426
02:04:23,703 --> 02:04:27,002
Difference is in numbers only
not in thoughts.

1427
02:04:28,174 --> 02:04:30,199
Father!
- Got angry?

1428
02:04:30,510 --> 02:04:31,704
Then show me!

1429
02:04:32,045 --> 02:04:34,707
You wrote a calculation in March
and failed the exam.

1430
02:04:34,881 --> 02:04:36,712
You got the same question
again in September.

1431
02:04:36,883 --> 02:04:39,215
What would you do?
What have you learnt meanwhile?

1432
02:04:40,053 --> 02:04:41,884
Show me the difference between
March and September.

1433
02:04:42,055 --> 02:04:43,215
What do you want me to do father?

1434
02:04:43,389 --> 02:04:45,721
Dharmaraju played a game of
dice only once,

1435
02:04:45,892 --> 02:04:47,553
it ended in the battle of Kurukshetra.

1436
02:04:48,227 --> 02:04:53,529
For betting Rs.10,000 one night,
you had to fight risking life.

1437
02:04:53,866 --> 02:04:55,857
Battle...go and battle.

1438
02:04:56,536 --> 02:04:59,369
l don't want just my Rs.5 lakhs!

1439
02:05:00,039 --> 02:05:03,736
Like me many clerks,
teachers, supervisors,

1440
02:05:03,910 --> 02:05:07,243
saved money for daughter's marriages,
son's education,

1441
02:05:07,380 --> 02:05:10,247
and to build homes after retirement.

1442
02:05:10,416 --> 02:05:13,579
lt's hard earned money with dreams.

1443
02:05:14,253 --> 02:05:18,087
Show me...bring back Rs.1,500 crores
and show me.

1444
02:05:18,591 --> 02:05:21,754
Tell me then that you're
different from Bittu.

1445
02:05:24,097 --> 02:05:25,394
l'll bring it back father.

1446
02:05:36,242 --> 02:05:42,112
You don't worry about this case,
l'll prove you didn't kill ACP.

1447
02:05:42,448 --> 02:05:45,110
You can't.
- Why?

1448
02:05:45,284 --> 02:05:47,445
He's not dead.
- Not dead?

1449
02:05:47,620 --> 02:05:50,282
What did ACP tell on phone
when he came to your home?

1450
02:05:50,456 --> 02:05:52,117
Don't park the car,
l'll be back immediately.

1451
02:05:52,291 --> 02:05:54,953
lt means driver was in the car.

1452
02:05:55,962 --> 02:05:58,760
lf ACP had died as you think,
there must be two bodies in the car.

1453
02:05:58,931 --> 02:06:00,091
How many?
- Two!

1454
02:06:00,266 --> 02:06:02,598
How many were there?
- One!

1455
02:06:02,802 --> 02:06:04,963
Then, the dead man is...
- Driver!

1456
02:06:06,439 --> 02:06:08,805
While coming out do you
know what did he say.

1457
02:06:08,975 --> 02:06:10,602
Just now talked to
Varadarajulu on phone.

1458
02:06:10,810 --> 02:06:13,301
Varadarajulu died yesterday and
he claims to have talked to him now.

1459
02:06:13,446 --> 02:06:15,812
ls Varadarajulu dead?
How do you know it?

1460
02:06:15,982 --> 02:06:17,813
We saw on TV while coming
out of the hospital.

1461
02:06:17,984 --> 02:06:21,147
Ex-MLA of Vizag East and
Co-operative bank Chairman,

1462
02:06:21,320 --> 02:06:24,812
Paidpalli Varadarajulu was
murdered in his guest house.

1463
02:06:24,991 --> 02:06:26,652
When did Rajamanikyam get into this?

1464
02:06:26,826 --> 02:06:32,128
May be he got a clue about the money
when we were in the dump yard.

1465
02:06:38,471 --> 02:06:39,631
lf my guess is right,

1466
02:06:39,839 --> 02:06:44,173
ACP would've gone the same
night to dump yard for money.

1467
02:06:46,345 --> 02:06:48,006
l'm sure he would've seen the money.

1468
02:07:09,001 --> 02:07:14,166
As soon as Bittu comes out,
each one of us can take Rs.500 crores.

1469
02:07:14,340 --> 02:07:17,207
Let's talk to lawyer and
send Bittu permanently to jail,

1470
02:07:17,376 --> 02:07:19,037
take Rs.750 crores each.

1471
02:07:19,212 --> 02:07:21,874
But they wouldn't have expected
Bittu would escape.

1472
02:07:22,048 --> 02:07:25,540
Bittu would've come to know the
game played by ACP and Varadarajulu.

1473
02:07:26,385 --> 02:07:28,216
That's why he killed Varadarajulu.

1474
02:07:28,387 --> 02:07:30,218
Why did he leave ACP then?

1475
02:07:30,389 --> 02:07:32,380
ACP knows where the money is!

1476
02:07:32,892 --> 02:07:35,053
lf he kills him, how can he
know where the money is!

1477
02:07:36,062 --> 02:07:38,360
That's why he would've bargained with him.

1478
02:08:04,924 --> 02:08:08,917
You knew he's villain
because of bomb blast,

1479
02:08:09,095 --> 02:08:13,395
but how did Bittu come to know about
the link between ACP and Varadarajulu?

1480
02:08:13,566 --> 02:08:16,729
Bittu thinks just like l think.

1481
02:08:16,936 --> 02:08:19,928
But this time he was 24 hours
earlier than me.

1482
02:08:20,940 --> 02:08:23,568
That's why my father is in hospital.

1483
02:08:24,110 --> 02:08:25,737
And my sister is with him.

1484
02:08:26,445 --> 02:08:27,776
l'm in a lock-up.

1485
02:08:28,447 --> 02:08:30,779
But still l'll spare that bastard.

1486
02:08:31,284 --> 02:08:33,616
l'll make him bite the bullet.
- How?

1487
02:08:38,791 --> 02:08:43,558
Catch...catch...

1488
02:08:44,130 --> 02:08:48,430
Who would dare stop you?

1489
02:08:54,140 --> 02:08:58,304
Settle the issue once for all...

1490
02:08:59,478 --> 02:09:03,972
Who is hiding behind the mask?
Find him quickly...

1491
02:09:04,150 --> 02:09:06,311
Leave behind your worries,
break the barricades...

1492
02:09:06,485 --> 02:09:09,147
Unmask them...

1493
02:09:09,322 --> 02:09:13,986
Are you one of the four
or one in a crore?

1494
02:09:14,160 --> 02:09:16,492
Rip out the mystery face
behind the shadowy mask...

1495
02:09:16,662 --> 02:09:19,130
Settle all the accounts...

1496
02:09:19,298 --> 02:09:24,167
Brother of Vikramarka
in determination...

1497
02:09:24,303 --> 02:09:26,794
Take them to task...

1498
02:09:27,173 --> 02:09:30,006
Catch him...catch him...

1499
02:10:02,375 --> 02:10:04,536
Rs.1,500 crores!

1500
02:10:07,880 --> 02:10:09,040
You'll not forget my Rs.750 crores, right?

1501
02:10:09,215 --> 02:10:10,375
Take it right now.

1502
02:10:21,060 --> 02:10:24,723
He asks money and when given
doesn't know how to take it.

1503
02:10:29,368 --> 02:10:31,063
Looking at him
l understood one thing,

1504
02:10:31,537 --> 02:10:35,701
not only earning money is difficult
but carrying so too difficult.

1505
02:10:44,083 --> 02:10:45,072
ls he dead?

1506
02:10:51,090 --> 02:10:52,079
Call Bittu!

1507
02:11:02,234 --> 02:11:04,259
Why is he calling at this hour?

1508
02:11:04,403 --> 02:11:06,894
He's not calling
someone has made him call.

1509
02:11:09,909 --> 02:11:11,604
Fix three containers.

1510
02:11:12,278 --> 02:11:13,939
Load one of them with money.

1511
02:11:18,117 --> 02:11:20,517
Before they find out which
container has money...

1512
02:11:25,624 --> 02:11:27,785
We can board a ship and
leave the country.

1513
02:11:27,960 --> 02:11:28,449
You?

1514
02:11:28,627 --> 02:11:32,256
There's an airport Tuticorin
in the Southern end of lndia,

1515
02:11:32,932 --> 02:11:34,263
Strange name, right?

1516
02:11:35,267 --> 02:11:37,758
Srilanka is just 10 minutes from there.

1517
02:11:38,437 --> 02:11:40,837
You come in the ship along with money.

1518
02:11:41,307 --> 02:11:44,538
l'll come in the flight.
- What about her?

1519
02:11:47,980 --> 02:11:49,811
Devayani will handle her.

1520
02:11:51,984 --> 02:11:54,475
The phone call he made went to
Vizag lndustrial area godowns.

1521
02:11:54,653 --> 02:11:57,486
lf he had picked the call,
we could trace the exact location.

1522
02:11:58,324 --> 02:11:59,313
We must go to Vizag immediately.

1523
02:11:59,492 --> 02:12:03,155
Vizag? We'll reach by midnight
even if we rush.- Yes.

1524
02:12:03,329 --> 02:12:04,956
He would've left the country by then.

1525
02:12:05,131 --> 02:12:07,622
Let's take a helicopter.
- Helicopter? Are you mad?

1526
02:12:09,301 --> 02:12:14,466
When robbers can use flights and ships,
can't we police use helicopters?

1527
02:12:14,640 --> 02:12:16,164
They'll not allow us into airport too.

1528
02:12:16,342 --> 02:12:17,809
They will!
- Who?

1529
02:12:17,977 --> 02:12:19,171
Your future son-in-law!

1530
02:12:19,979 --> 02:12:20,809
He's a pilot, right?

1531
02:12:21,013 --> 02:12:25,006
l've already fixed her marriage.
Groom is a pilot.

1532
02:12:25,184 --> 02:12:27,175
Why would he give us?
- l'll talk to him.

1533
02:12:27,353 --> 02:12:28,342
Like this?

1534
02:12:30,523 --> 02:12:31,512
l'll beg him.

1535
02:12:32,024 --> 02:12:33,685
lf necessary l'll fall at his feet.

1536
02:12:34,360 --> 02:12:37,523
Begumpet Airport, Hyderabad
- How dare you beat me!

1537
02:12:37,863 --> 02:12:40,491
l don't have any connection
with this incident.

1538
02:12:40,666 --> 02:12:42,827
Will you please talk to my
daughter. lt'll ease your pin.

1539
02:12:43,002 --> 02:12:45,197
lf you talk about your daughter
again, l'll kill you.

1540
02:12:46,005 --> 02:12:48,530
Are you happy now?
Marriage was also fixed.

1541
02:12:48,674 --> 02:12:49,663
You spoilt it.

1542
02:12:49,842 --> 02:12:52,003
Why do you feel so much?
Does he own the helicopter?

1543
02:12:52,211 --> 02:12:53,371
He's just a driver.

1544
02:12:53,546 --> 02:12:55,605
Shut up! Enough of what
you'd already done.

1545
02:13:25,578 --> 02:13:27,045
Where are we to search for them?

1546
02:13:27,246 --> 02:13:29,407
Search the road from
industrial area to port.

1547
02:13:29,582 --> 02:13:30,571
Which vehicles?

1548
02:13:30,749 --> 02:13:33,582
Only containers can carry
so much cash. Look there!

1549
02:13:37,423 --> 02:13:38,412
Three vehicles are there!

1550
02:13:38,591 --> 02:13:40,752
Which one of the three has money?

1551
02:13:40,926 --> 02:13:43,759
Simple Sir,
the one carrying money has weight,

1552
02:13:43,929 --> 02:13:45,226
it's tyres would get pressed!

1553
02:13:46,899 --> 02:13:48,560
Orange one has money!

1554
02:13:48,734 --> 02:13:49,894
Tell me where it is heading!

1555
02:13:50,069 --> 02:13:51,900
l'll tell you what to do
after getting down.

1556
02:13:52,271 --> 02:13:53,738
Your sister is with him.

1557
02:13:53,906 --> 02:13:56,898
He won't harm my sister till
money reaches port.

1558
02:14:00,913 --> 02:14:02,938
A helicopter is landing!

1559
02:14:13,459 --> 02:14:15,290
Can you hear me Sir?
- Tell me Ravi.

1560
02:14:15,461 --> 02:14:16,951
Follow the orange vehicle Sir.
- Just a minute.

1561
02:14:17,129 --> 02:14:18,619
Got it.
- Where is it heading?

1562
02:14:21,100 --> 02:14:22,931
East!
- Who is the driver?

1563
02:14:25,938 --> 02:14:28,304
l'm sure the money is in that vehicle.
Don't leave him.

1564
02:14:29,475 --> 02:14:31,466
How would you stop him from
reaching the port?

1565
02:14:33,112 --> 02:14:34,306
Leave it to me.

1566
02:14:43,822 --> 02:14:45,483
Where are you?
- On beach road.

1567
02:14:45,658 --> 02:14:46,647
Where exactly?

1568
02:14:46,825 --> 02:14:47,655
My bike is broken down.

1569
02:14:47,826 --> 02:14:49,987
l'm climbing the steep of St.Anns!
- Listen carefully.

1570
02:14:50,162 --> 02:14:53,461
Go immediately and ring the
final bell in St.Alphonse school.- Why?

1571
02:14:53,632 --> 02:14:55,031
Just follow my order!

1572
02:14:56,969 --> 02:14:59,335
Has orange colour container
reached the pace?- lt has!

1573
02:14:59,505 --> 02:15:00,335
Children are crossing the road.

1574
02:15:00,506 --> 02:15:02,337
Road is blocked and
vehicle has stopped.

1575
02:15:02,975 --> 02:15:04,499
Fast!- lt's reversing!

1576
02:15:04,977 --> 02:15:07,343
lt is taking right.
- lt's going towards MPS side.

1577
02:15:08,347 --> 02:15:09,678
Who is that side?

1578
02:15:09,848 --> 02:15:12,009
Padhu has gone there to
get his car repaired.

1579
02:15:12,184 --> 02:15:14,015
Call him, he's there only.

1580
02:15:20,526 --> 02:15:21,857
Who is right before you?

1581
02:15:22,027 --> 02:15:24,188
Buddy, he looks like a wrestler!

1582
02:15:24,363 --> 02:15:26,661
What are you doing?
- Having tea.

1583
02:15:26,832 --> 02:15:28,663
Throw it on his face!
- May lead to fight!

1584
02:15:28,834 --> 02:15:30,165
Throw it on his face!

1585
02:15:32,538 --> 02:15:34,005
How dare you throw tea on my face!

1586
02:15:43,549 --> 02:15:46,541
People are beating up each other
for throwing tea on face!

1587
02:15:46,719 --> 02:15:48,550
Send additional force immediately.

1588
02:15:48,721 --> 02:15:50,052
ls the vehicle taking right or left?

1589
02:15:50,222 --> 02:15:53,214
lt is taking the right side.
- Sure?- Yes

1590
02:15:57,062 --> 02:16:00,361
He's going very fast,
he'll reach the flyover in 10 minutes.

1591
02:16:00,532 --> 02:16:03,194
lf he gets into the flyover,
he'll reach the port directly.

1592
02:16:03,402 --> 02:16:05,563
Stop him!
- He won't reach.

1593
02:16:06,572 --> 02:16:08,403
Always hearing radio Mirchi?

1594
02:16:09,041 --> 02:16:12,033
My will and wish, l'll listen that only.

1595
02:16:18,250 --> 02:16:19,581
Where are you?
- ln studio.

1596
02:16:19,752 --> 02:16:22,414
Say there's traffic jam
on flyover leading to port.

1597
02:16:22,588 --> 02:16:23,247
But that road is free, right?

1598
02:16:23,589 --> 02:16:25,079
Didn't you ever tell a lie?

1599
02:16:26,258 --> 02:16:27,589
Traffic update to listeners,

1600
02:16:27,760 --> 02:16:29,421
traffic is little heavy
on flyover to harbour,

1601
02:16:29,595 --> 02:16:33,554
if possible try to avoid it,
if not wait in the traffic,

1602
02:16:33,732 --> 02:16:35,427
listening to the super hit song.

1603
02:16:41,774 --> 02:16:44,436
He has taken a U-turn to right.

1604
02:16:49,281 --> 02:16:50,270
Where are you taking him?

1605
02:16:50,449 --> 02:16:52,610
lt'll keep on roaming till
Bittu is finished.

1606
02:16:52,785 --> 02:16:55,777
Though he has the steering,
he'll drive as l command.

1607
02:16:59,291 --> 02:17:00,280
Take right!

1608
02:17:02,294 --> 02:17:03,283
Right again!

1609

Depositors Relay Fast

1612
02:17:56,515 --> 02:17:59,245
You made them bring it to the
place from where they stole!

1613
02:18:03,689 --> 02:18:07,853
Catch him!

1614
02:18:12,164 --> 02:18:14,655
Hey Stop!...

1615
02:18:26,712 --> 02:18:29,044
Rs.1,500 crores!

1616
02:18:29,715 --> 02:18:32,548
Didn't let you take even a rupee!

1617
02:18:33,218 --> 02:18:35,209
Coming, l'm coming to you!

1618
02:18:36,722 --> 02:18:38,053
Where are you going Ravi?

1619
02:18:38,223 --> 02:18:41,715
Bittu would be heading to port,
l'll meet you after killing him.

1620
02:18:45,063 --> 02:18:46,587
Go to the port!

1621
02:18:47,533 --> 02:18:49,865
This is not an auto to turn
as you say!

1622
02:18:54,373 --> 02:18:55,032
Go!

1623
02:18:56,742 --> 02:18:59,074
Bittu, your man hasn't come yet.

1624
02:19:01,413 --> 02:19:02,641
l'm coming there.

1625
02:20:03,442 --> 02:20:04,636
How could you do that?

1626
02:20:16,321 --> 02:20:16,810
Like this!

1627
02:21:09,041 --> 02:21:10,508
Kill him...

1628
02:21:14,346 --> 02:21:16,041
Will you kill me and
help him to get down?

1629
02:21:16,882 --> 02:21:18,042
l'm his fan!

1630
02:21:18,550 --> 02:21:20,381
He must always be on top!

1631
02:21:23,889 --> 02:21:26,221
Come...come...come...

1632
02:22:40,932 --> 02:22:43,867
Come... Come...

1633
02:22:45,971 --> 02:22:47,097
Feeling breathlessness!

1634
02:22:52,444 --> 02:22:53,809
He has Asthma too!

1635
02:22:59,818 --> 02:23:04,482
Will you kill?
Don't you care about human life?

1636
02:23:04,656 --> 02:23:08,649
lntelligent like us mustn't fight.
We must discuss.

1637
02:23:12,164 --> 02:23:13,631
You can kill him.

1638
02:23:19,838 --> 02:23:22,830
Leave it, do as you like it.

1639
02:23:23,642 --> 02:23:24,540
Stop!

1640
02:23:28,013 --> 02:23:31,176
l said let's discuss,
why did you shoot me?

1641
02:23:32,350 --> 02:23:35,342
Leave me...leave me.

1642
02:23:35,520 --> 02:23:39,354
l'll tell you where your sister is!
- No, don't tell!

1643
02:23:39,858 --> 02:23:44,352
Don't provoke me, if l get angry...

1644
02:23:44,529 --> 02:23:47,987
When the first light of the
Vizag is switched on,

1645
02:23:48,166 --> 02:23:49,861
l'll kill your sister.

1646
02:23:52,170 --> 02:23:52,864
Kill her!

1647
02:23:53,038 --> 02:23:55,336
Have you gone mad?
l'll really kill her.

1648
02:23:55,507 --> 02:23:58,670
Will you kill her?
Come on kill her!

1649
02:23:59,377 --> 02:24:03,711
Even a thief like me got
angry for losing brother.

1650
02:24:03,882 --> 02:24:06,373
She's your sister!
- So what?

1651
02:24:06,718 --> 02:24:09,551
Don't you've sentiments?
- No! l'm a beast,

1652
02:24:09,721 --> 02:24:12,053
l'll eat when l'm hungry.
lf l get angry l'll kill!

1653
02:24:16,728 --> 02:24:18,389
Did you get him?

1654
02:24:19,698 --> 02:24:21,188
Please save me!

1655
02:24:21,366 --> 02:24:24,028
Got him...got him...stop...
- Please save me.

1656
02:24:24,202 --> 02:24:27,535
Please save me Sir,
he may kill me.

1657
02:24:28,907 --> 02:24:30,898
l forgot to bring handcuffs.

1658
02:24:31,076 --> 02:24:33,909
Rubber band is enough!
l'll not run away!

1659
02:24:34,079 --> 02:24:36,741
No need to put him jail
like keeping trash in a locker.

1660
02:24:36,915 --> 02:24:39,577
Jail costume, omelette on Sunday,
biryani on Wednesday,

1661
02:24:39,751 --> 02:24:42,584
Govt. would lose money.
- l'm pure vegetarian Sir.

1662
02:24:42,754 --> 02:24:44,415
lf you kill him,
you'll get into trouble.

1663
02:24:44,589 --> 02:24:46,250
l'll get into trouble
only if his body is found.

1664
02:24:46,424 --> 02:24:48,756
Let's bury him, no one would
know other than us.

1665
02:24:51,263 --> 02:24:52,389
Why are you looking at me?

1666
02:24:56,401 --> 02:24:57,925
Let's finish him too!

1667
02:24:58,403 --> 02:24:59,734
One bullet two bodies!

1668
02:25:00,739 --> 02:25:03,572
Don't think Sir,
l'll get better proposals than him.

1669
02:25:03,742 --> 02:25:06,734
He's a mad dog.
- How dare you call me a dog!

1670
02:25:06,945 --> 02:25:10,346
lf you say so l'll kill you like a dog.
l'm not used to guns too!

1671
02:25:10,782 --> 02:25:13,683
lt's not an achievement for you
to kill him, it should not be.

1672
02:25:14,119 --> 02:25:14,949
Leave me for once, l'll kill him.

1673
02:25:15,120 --> 02:25:18,453
l'm telling considering you as
my eldest son, listen to me.

1674
02:25:18,623 --> 02:25:19,783
Drop the gun!

1675
02:25:24,129 --> 02:25:27,257
Rogues like him have no rules.
Only good people have all the rules.

1676
02:25:27,432 --> 02:25:28,956
No Ravi!

1677
02:25:42,814 --> 02:25:44,304
lndeed it is an achievement
for me to kill him!

1678
02:25:44,482 --> 02:25:48,646
You're right,
criminals like him mustn't live.

1679
02:25:48,820 --> 02:25:50,151
He would've shot you.

1680
02:25:50,322 --> 02:25:54,156
No way, to shoot his gun
must have bullets, right?

1681
02:25:55,160 --> 02:25:57,993
You mean his gun...?
- Empty!

1682
02:25:59,631 --> 02:26:01,622
Did you play the drama
with an empty gun?

1683
02:26:01,800 --> 02:26:04,792
Did you expect me to kill him
and go to jail? No way Sir!

1684
02:26:05,303 --> 02:26:07,168
Where are you going now?
- To my sister.

1685
02:26:13,511 --> 02:26:15,843
May be she'll harm your sister
hearing the sound of helicopter.

1686
02:26:16,014 --> 02:26:18,005
No Sir, she's deaf and mute.
She can't hear.

1687
02:26:40,505 --> 02:26:41,836
Hold this, don't eat!

1688
02:26:55,720 --> 02:26:56,709
Raji, it's me!

1689
02:26:56,888 --> 02:26:59,880
Why did you hand over me to the girl?

1690
02:27:00,058 --> 02:27:01,548
ls she bothered about hand only?

1691
02:27:01,726 --> 02:27:03,887
lsn't she bothered about
whose hand it is?

1692
02:27:06,197 --> 02:27:07,858
Why are you beating me?
- Why are you laughing?

1693
02:27:08,033 --> 02:27:10,058
l took so much risk for you She-Devil!

1694
02:27:10,201 --> 02:27:11,862
Why did you take so much time?

1695
02:27:13,705 --> 02:27:15,070
She has a gun too!

1696
02:27:21,079 --> 02:27:22,410
Did you eat the peanuts
or keeping with you?

1697
02:27:22,580 --> 02:27:25,743
ls it time to eat peanuts? Fool!

1698
02:27:25,917 --> 02:27:27,748
Throw the peanuts on her face!

1699
02:27:28,753 --> 02:27:29,742
Hold her hand with the gun.

1700
02:27:29,921 --> 02:27:33,755
She's not leaving it.
- Give her a tight punch!

1701
02:27:36,261 --> 02:27:37,421
Are you still there Sir?

1702
02:27:37,595 --> 02:27:40,063
Did you study astrology?

1703
02:27:40,231 --> 02:27:43,894
How did you know your sister is here?
- He told me.

1704
02:27:44,102 --> 02:27:49,267
When the first light of Vizag is
switched on, l'll kill your sister.

1705
02:27:50,275 --> 02:27:52,607
First lamp to be switched on
in Vizag is...

1706
02:27:54,279 --> 02:27:55,109
...lighthouse!

1707
02:28:02,287 --> 02:28:04,448
How could you guess it
in so much tension?

1708
02:28:04,622 --> 02:28:06,613
Anyone can answer while in class.

1709
02:28:06,791 --> 02:28:09,851
Only the one who writes in exam
would be the topper.

1710
02:28:13,264 --> 02:28:15,255
Going to attend interview?

1711
02:28:15,433 --> 02:28:16,593
How much would you get?

1712
02:28:16,935 --> 02:28:18,129

1713
02:28:19,771 --> 02:28:21,830
How much time would it
take to earn a lakh?

1714
02:28:22,774 --> 02:28:23,934
4 months!

1715
02:28:24,776 --> 02:28:26,767
What would happen if you earn
a lakh in two hours?

1716
02:28:28,646 --> 02:28:31,137
l'll face problems father.
- Good! Go!

1717
02:28:33,485 --> 02:28:34,645
You gave me Rs.5,000, right?

1718
02:28:34,819 --> 02:28:37,310
Watch out l'll make it
Rs.50,000 in an hour.

1719
02:28:38,323 --> 02:28:40,484
Did they give Rs.5,000?
- Yes.

1720
02:28:40,658 --> 02:28:41,647
They will give.

1721
02:28:41,826 --> 02:28:43,817
lf you take it, you'll lose your skin!

1722
02:28:43,995 --> 02:28:45,963
Listen to me,
return the money to them.

1723
02:28:46,131 --> 02:28:48,793
Take Rs.100, evening go to watch a film.
You'll come good in life.

1724

l'm unable to travel in bus.

1725
02:28:57,976 --> 02:29:01,343
Please buy me a Scooty
immediately after our marriage.

1726
02:29:01,513 --> 02:29:02,502

1727
02:29:02,680 --> 02:29:04,341

treasure to people,

1733
02:29:20,999 --> 02:29:22,489
